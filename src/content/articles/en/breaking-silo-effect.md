## Overcoming Organizational Rigidity 
### Business Development as Silo Breaking

Division of labor exists to accomplish tasks.  
Yet excessive division of labor slows organizational progress, even leading to collapse.

This is the "Silo Effect."

Simply put, this is departmentalism.  
But the root of the problem isn't division of labor itself.  
It's "insufficient information flow."

The less transparent information becomes, the more easily systems become rigid and stuck.

### The Cost of Information Transparency

Making information flow within and outside organizations requires paying a price:

1. Investing in management costs (someone must take responsibility).  
2. Innovative management thinking (treating communication seriously).  
3. Leadership vision that keeps pace with the times (when direction is wrong, effort is wasted).

Any large organization needs people to serve as "translators."  
They understand different domains and blend people with different expertise together, moving toward the same direction.

### Identifying Silos: Two Scenarios

In practical negotiations, when do you realize the other party is a "silo"?

Scenario One:  
Meetings with a dozen people sitting in rows, representatives from every department present.  
Each meeting replaces one-third of the attendees, but the point person remains the same.  
After three months, aside from collecting dozens of business cards, there's no progress.

Scenario Two:  
Every meeting has a different point person.  
Planning is planning, procurement is procurement, contracts are contracts.  
They're discussing the same project, but they can't even sort things out internally.

When encountering these two situations, please exercise extreme caution in managing negotiation costs.

### Solutions Beyond Organization

Transcending organization is key to breaking through organization.

The core mission of business development (BD)  
is understanding the focal points of each department in the negotiating party.

Try to stand at the height they need and coordinate gaps.  
Become an effective information provider.  
You must "lead" your partner's team in reverse, guiding them forward.

Or,  
End the meeting immediately without wasting time on futile efforts.  
Prepare for the next, more promising opportunity.
