# Overcoming Organizational Rigidity
## Business Development as Silo-Breaking

We divide labor to accomplish tasks.
Yet excessive division of labor slows organizational progress, even leading to collapse.

This is the *Silo Effect*.

Simply put, it's departmentalism.
But the crux of the problem isn't division of labor itself.
Rather, it's "insufficient information flow."

The less transparent information becomes, the more systems tend toward rigidity and ossification.

## The Cost of Information Transparency

Making information flow within and beyond organizations requires paying a price:

1. Investing in management costs (someone must take responsibility).
2. Innovating management mindset (treating communication seriously).
3. Leadership vision that evolves with the times (wrong direction renders effort futile).

Any large organization needs people who serve as "translators."
They understand different domains and blend people with different expertise together, moving toward the same direction.

## Identifying Silos: Two Scenarios

In practical negotiations, when do you realize the other party is a "silo"?

Scenario One:
Meetings with a dozen people sitting in rows, representatives from every department.
Each meeting replaces one-third of attendees, but the contact person remains the same.
After three months, aside from consuming dozens of business cards, there's no progress.

Scenario Two:
Different contact persons at every meeting.
Planning belongs to planning, procurement to procurement, contracts to contracts.
They're discussing the same project, but they can't even coordinate internally.

When encountering these two situations, exercise extreme caution in managing negotiation costs.

## Solutions Beyond Organization

Transcend organization to break organization.

The core mission of business development (BD)
is understanding the focal concerns of each department in the negotiating party.

Try standing at the height they need, coordinating discrepancies.
Become an effective information provider.
You must reverse-"lead" your partner's team, guiding them forward.

Or alternatively,
immediately end the meeting without wasting time on futile consumption.
Prepare for the next more promising opportunity.
