## Overcoming Organizational Rigidity
### Business Development as Breaking Down Silos

Division of labor exists to complete tasks.  
Yet excessive division slows organizational progress, even leading to collapse.

This is the "Silo Effect."

Simply put, it's departmentalism.  
But the crux of the problem isn't division of labor itself.  
Rather, it's "insufficient information flow."

The less transparent information becomes, the more rigid and entrenched the system grows.

### The Cost of Information Transparency

Making information flow within and beyond organizations requires paying a price:

1. Investing management costs (someone must take responsibility).  
2. Innovating management thinking (treating communication seriously).  
3. Leadership vision that evolves with the times (wrong direction makes effort futile).

Any large organization needs people to serve as "translators."  
They understand different domains and blend people with different expertise together, moving toward the same direction.

### Identifying Silos: Two Scenarios

In practical negotiations, when do you realize the other party is a "silo"?

Scenario One:  
Meetings with a dozen people sitting in rows, representatives from every department present.  
Each meeting replaces one-third of the attendees, but the contact person remains the same.  
After three months of meetings, aside from collecting dozens of business cards, there's zero progress.

Scenario Two:  
Every meeting has a different contact person.  
Planning belongs to planning, procurement to procurement, contracts to contracts.  
They're discussing the same project, but they can't even coordinate internally.

When encountering these two situations, exercise extreme caution in managing negotiation costs.

### Solutions Beyond Organization

Transcending organization is the key to breaking down organization.

The core mission of business development (BD)  
is understanding the focal points of each department in the negotiating party.

Try to stand at the height they need, coordinating the gaps.  
Become an effective information provider.  
You must reverse-"lead" your partner's team, guiding them forward.

Or alternatively,  
immediately end the meeting, avoiding wasted time on futile endeavors.  
Prepare for the next, more promising opportunity.
