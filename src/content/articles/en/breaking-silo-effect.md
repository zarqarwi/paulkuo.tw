## Overcoming Organizational Rigidity 
### Business Development as Silo-Breaking

Division of labor exists to accomplish tasks.
Yet excessive division of labor slows organizational progress, even leading to collapse.

This is the "Silo Effect."

Simply put, this is departmentalism.
But the crux of the problem isn't division of labor itself.
Rather, it's "insufficient information flow."

The less transparent information becomes, the more easily systems become rigid and entrenched.

### The Cost of Information Transparency

Making information flow within and beyond organizations requires paying a price:

1. Investing in management costs (someone must take responsibility).
2. Innovating management thinking (treating communication seriously).
3. Leadership height keeping pace with the times (when direction is wrong, effort is wasted).

Any large organization needs people to serve as "translators."
They understand different domains and blend people with different expertise together, moving in the same direction.

### Identifying Silos: Two Scenarios

In practical negotiations, when do you realize the other party is a "silo"?

Scenario One:
In meetings, a dozen people sit in rows, with representatives from every department.
Each meeting replaces one-third of the attendees, but the contact person remains the same.
After three months of meetings, aside from going through dozens of business cards, there's no progress.

Scenario Two:
The contact person changes with every meeting.
Planning is planning, procurement is procurement, contracts are contracts.
They're discussing the same project, but they can't even coordinate internally.

When encountering these two situations, exercise extreme caution in managing negotiation costs.

### Solutions Beyond Organization

Transcending organization is the way to break through organization.

The core mission of business development (BD)
is understanding the key concerns of each department in the negotiating party.

Try to stand at the height they need, coordinating the gaps.
Become an effective information provider.
You must conversely "lead" your partner's team, guiding them forward.

Or alternatively,
immediately end the meeting without wasting time on futile consumption.
Prepare for the next more promising opportunity.
