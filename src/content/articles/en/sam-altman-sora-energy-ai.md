title: "Before Sunrise: Sam Altman on Sora, Energy, and the AI Ecosystem (Empire)"
description: "What supports the AI revolution is not just the breakthrough of a single model, but the systematic reconstruction of energy, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Sam Altman points out that scaling up to reduce the 'cost of intelligence' is the core driving force. From Sora as a starting point for world simulation to AI's potential participation in scientific discovery, AI is changing the world with a gradual 'sunrise' approach. The ultimate bottleneck of all this will depend on revolutionary advances in energy technologies like nuclear fusion."

In this A16Z interview, Sam Altman isn't talking about a single model. He's discussing the systemic elements that support the entire AI revolution: energy, infrastructure, social adaptation, and how to truly build a sustainable AI ecosystem.

## Reducing the "Cost of Intelligence"

OpenAI's architecture consists of three components forming a self-reinforcing flywheel: frontier research labs, large-scale infrastructure, and personalized AI applications.

The core driving force of this cycle is continuously reducing the "cost of intelligence" through constant scaling up. Cost reduction enables AI application proliferation; the returns from applications can in turn fund even larger infrastructure.

## Sora: Gateway to World Simulation

Sora is not just a video generator. Its true potential lies in becoming the beginning of a "world simulator." It forces AI to start understanding and simulating the causal laws of the physical world. This is a crucial step for AI to transition from understanding text to understanding complex dynamic worlds, essential for achieving AGI in the future.

Building on this foundation, Altman believes future "AI scientists" will be able to participate in the process of scientific discovery (proposing hypotheses, designing experiments), and the pace of scientific progress may undergo a qualitative change.

## Energy: Bottleneck and Ultimate Bet

Behind compute expansion lies enormous electricity and land demands. The future development of AI is directly tied to energy costs.

Short-term reliance on traditional energy sources like natural gas, mid-term on solar and energy storage technologies, and the long-term ultimate bet is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion has the potential to bring about orders-of-magnitude reductions in energy costs, thereby completely removing constraints on AI compute expansion.

## Conclusion: Rhythm and Sunrise

A thriving AI ecosystem needs to provide a stable, predictable, and accountable platform—this is an engineering of trust.

Altman believes AGI's arrival won't be an instantaneous explosion, but more like a "sunrise." Light gradually spreads across the earth, and society will have sufficient time to adapt and adjust. What matters most is not predicting when the sun will fully rise, but adjusting ourselves, aligning with the pace of this transformation, and participating in it.
