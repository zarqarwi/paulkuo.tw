title: "Before Sunrise: Sam Altman on Sora, Energy, and the AI Ecosystem (Empire)"
description: "What sustains the AI revolution is not a single model breakthrough, but a systemic restructuring of energy, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Sam Altman points out that reducing 'the cost of intelligence' through scale is the core driving force. From Sora as the starting point for a world simulator, to AI's potential in scientific discovery, AI is transforming the world like a gradual sunrise. And the ultimate bottleneck will depend on revolutionary breakthroughs in energy technologies like nuclear fusion."

In this A16Z interview, Sam Altman isn't talking about a single model. He's discussing the systemic elements sustaining the entire AI revolution: energy, infrastructure, social adaptation, and how to build a truly sustainable AI ecosystem.

## Reducing "The Cost of Intelligence"

OpenAI's architecture forms a self-reinforcing flywheel from three components: a frontier research lab, large-scale infrastructure, and personalized AI applications.

The core driving force of this cycle is continuously reducing "the cost of intelligence" through scaling. Falling costs make AI applications accessible; the returns from those applications fund even more massive infrastructure.

## Sora: Gateway to a World Simulator

Sora is not just a video generator. Its real potential lies in being the beginning of a "world simulator." It forces AI to begin understanding and simulating the causal laws of the physical world. This is a critical step from understanding text to comprehending complex dynamic worlds — essential for achieving AGI.

Building on this, Altman believes future "AI scientists" will participate in the process of scientific discovery — formulating hypotheses, designing experiments — potentially transforming the pace of scientific progress.

## Energy: The Bottleneck and Ultimate Bet

Behind compute expansion lies massive demand for electricity and land. AI's future development is directly tied to energy costs.

Short-term, traditional energy sources like natural gas provide support. Mid-term, solar and storage technologies take over. Long-term, the ultimate bet is nuclear fusion. Fusion has the potential to deliver orders-of-magnitude cost reduction in energy, completely unleashing AI's compute expansion.

## Conclusion: Rhythm and Sunrise

A thriving AI ecosystem requires a stable, predictable, and settleable platform — this is an exercise in trust.

Altman believes AGI won't arrive as a sudden explosion, but more like a "sunrise." Light gradually spreads across the land, giving society ample time to adapt and adjust. The most important thing is not predicting when the sun will fully rise, but calibrating yourself to align with the pace of change and stepping in.
