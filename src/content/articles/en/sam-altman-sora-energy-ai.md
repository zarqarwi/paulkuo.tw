title: "Before Sunrise: Sam Altman on Sora, Energy, and the AI Ecosystem (Empire)"
description: "What supports the AI revolution is not merely the breakthrough of a single model, but the systematic reconstruction of energy, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Sam Altman points out that scaling to reduce the 'cost of intelligence' is the core driving force. From Sora as a starting point for world simulation to AI's potential participation in scientific discovery, AI is changing the world with a gradual 'sunrise' approach. The ultimate bottleneck for all of this will depend on revolutionary advances in energy technologies like nuclear fusion."

In this A16Z interview, Sam Altman discusses not a single model, but the systematic elements that support the entire AI revolution: energy, infrastructure, social adaptation, and how to truly build a sustainable AI ecosystem.

## Reducing the "Cost of Intelligence"

OpenAI's architecture consists of three components forming a self-reinforcing flywheel: frontier research lab, large-scale infrastructure, and personalized AI applications.

The core driving force of this cycle is continuously reducing the "cost of intelligence" through constant scaling. Cost reduction enables AI application adoption; the returns from applications can in turn fund even larger infrastructure.

## Sora: Gateway to World Simulation

Sora is not merely a video generator. Its true potential lies in becoming the beginning of a "world simulator." It forces AI to start understanding and simulating the causal laws of the physical world. This is a crucial step for AI to move from understanding text to understanding complex dynamic worlds, essential for achieving AGI in the future.

Building on this foundation, Altman believes future "AI scientists" will be able to participate in the process of scientific discovery (proposing hypotheses, designing experiments), and the pace of scientific progress may undergo qualitative change.

## Energy: Bottlenecks and the Ultimate Bet

Behind compute expansion lies enormous electricity and land requirements. AI's future development is directly tied to energy costs.

Short-term reliance on traditional energy sources like natural gas, medium-term dependence on solar and energy storage technologies, and the long-term ultimate bet is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion has the potential to bring orders of magnitude reduction in energy costs, thereby completely removing constraints on AI compute expansion.

## Conclusion: Rhythm and Sunrise

A thriving AI ecosystem needs to provide a stable, predictable, and accountable platform—this is an engineering of trust.

Altman believes that the arrival of AGI will not be an instantaneous explosion, but more like a "sunrise." Light gradually spreads across the earth, and society will have sufficient time to adapt and adjust. What matters most is not predicting when the sun will fully rise, but adjusting ourselves properly, aligning with the progress of this transformation, and immersing ourselves in it.
