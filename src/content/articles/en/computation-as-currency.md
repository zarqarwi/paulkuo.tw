title: "The Algorithmic Standard Era: When Knowledge, Electricity, and Currency Converge"
description: "Digital currency reveals the interconnected relationship between electricity, computation, and money. When knowledge can be mathematicized and pegged to currency, we enter a new economic model with computational power as the standard of value."

## The Algorithmic Standard Era
### When Knowledge, Electricity, and Currency Converge

Viewing Bitcoin transactions through the lens of energy consumption yields fascinating insights.
Electric power, through computational capacity, becomes linked to monetary systems.

This transforms the relationship between "electricity, computation, and currency"
into a set of linear equations with defined rules.

### Brainpower Equals Algorithms

With the rise of AI, knowledge has entered the realm of quantified algorithmic logic.

From this we can deduce:
Knowledge, too, is a form of algorithm.

Since it is algorithmic, knowledge has the potential to be mathematicized and quantified.
The "knowledge economy" we speak of will be able to link more clearly with currency.

The heights of problem-solving, the entrepreneurship of system creation—
these have value because the "computational power" required behind them is extraordinarily strong.

### From Gold Standard to Energy Standard

Compared to the traditional "gold standard" and "dollar standard,"
an "energy standard" may be a more fitting measure of value for digital technology.

In other words:
"Computational power" is a new standard of value and pricing.

Capital can purchase electricity.
Capital intervenes in algorithms through electricity to acquire core knowledge.
Conversely, individuals possessing critical knowledge can work backward to create revenue possibilities.

### Conclusion: The Alchemy of Traffic

Following this line of reasoning, the "influencer phenomenon" becomes readily comprehensible.

An influencer's talent, channeled through internet algorithmic platforms, aggregates traffic.
Through the intrinsic relationship between traffic and computational power, this converts into "energy standard" currency, then transfers into the familiar dollar-standard system.

Commerce seeks to reach everywhere.
Commerce seeks more efficient conversion.

The key was never scale.
But rather the efficiency of conversion with computational power.
