title: "The Age of Computational Standard: When Knowledge, Electricity, and Currency Become One"
subtitle: "Future wealth isn't about how much money you have—it's about how much computational power you command"
description: "From the electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining to the training costs of AI models, electrical power is becoming the new benchmark for measuring value. When knowledge can be computed, computation requires electricity, and electricity can be priced, what we're witnessing isn't just a new economic model—it's a fundamental redefinition of what 'value' means."
abstract: |
  Bitcoin mines currency with electricity; AI refines knowledge with computational power. As the relationship between knowledge, electricity, and currency tightens, we're witnessing a paradigm shift in how value is measured—from the gold standard to the dollar standard, and now to the "computational power standard." Drawing from his entrepreneurial experience and observations on energy issues, Paul sketches a future most people haven't yet seen clearly: your value will increasingly depend on how much computational power you can mobilize.

In late 2017, Bitcoin was closing in on $20,000. But what really made me pause wasn't the price—it was a different set of numbers: according to estimates at the time, the annual electricity consumed by global Bitcoin mining had already surpassed the total annual electricity consumption of Ireland.

A decentralized digital ledger, consuming the electrical output of an entire developed nation.

The essence of this isn't as simple as "mining is wasteful." It reveals a deeper equation: in the world of Bitcoin, electricity = computational power = currency. The more electricity you put in, the more computational power you produce; the more math problems your compute can solve, the more Bitcoin you get back. This equation is so clean it almost resembles a law of physics.

## When Knowledge Becomes Something You Can Compute

Take this logic one step further. The rise of AI has made another equation increasingly clear: knowledge ≈ algorithms.

What does this mean? We used to say "knowledge is power," but that power was vague, hard to measure. A doctor's diagnostic ability is "very valuable," but how much exactly? A lawyer's legal analysis is "irreplaceable," but to what degree?

Now, AI has made these questions quantifiable. How much compute does it take to train a medical imaging recognition model? How many GPU hours are needed to fine-tune a legal document summarization system? When knowledge is broken down into something that can be trained, replicated, and mass-produced as algorithms, its "price" emerges.

This isn't about devaluing knowledge. Quite the opposite—it's about finding an unprecedented pricing mechanism for knowledge.

## From the Gold Standard to the Computational Power Standard

Humanity's monetary system has gone through several major transitions.

In the gold standard era, the value of currency was anchored to gold. The bills in your hand had value because they were backed by corresponding gold reserves. Later, the Bretton Woods system collapsed, ushering in the dollar standard—currency's value was no longer anchored to gold, but to America's economic strength and military power.

So what's the next "standard"?

I believe the clue lies at the intersection of Bitcoin and AI. When electricity can produce currency (Bitcoin), and electricity can also produce knowledge (AI models), then electricity—or more precisely, computational power—is the most fundamental standard of value in our era.

Whoever controls computational power controls the printing press of the new age.

This is why NVIDIA's market cap has skyrocketed to the global top ranks in just a few years. It's not because their GPUs are particularly beautiful—it's because they're selling "tickets to computational power." Control the supply of compute, and you control the spigot of this new economic system.

## An Entrepreneur's Visceral Understanding

Running SDTI gave me a very personal sense of "computational power as value."

In the early years as a digital transformation consultant, the most common question from clients was: "What's the ROI on this project?" We spent a lot of time explaining why digitalization matters, why data-driven approaches are the trend. But at the end of the day, clients cared about one thing: how much goes in, how much comes out?

Then AI tools became widely available, and the answer to that question became strikingly direct. Market analysis that used to require three people working for a week could now be completed by one person with an AI assistant in a single day. Three salaries versus one computer's electricity bill plus API costs—any boss can do that math.

The cost of knowledge work is being recalculated as "the cost of computational power." And the cost of computational power, at its root, is the electricity bill.

This follows exactly the same logic as manufacturing. Factories use electricity to power machines that produce physical goods, while today's [knowledge workers use electricity to power AI that produces digital output](/articles/canary-in-coal-mine-ai-employment). The only difference: a factory's output is tangible objects; AI's output is intangible intelligence. But the underlying logic of energy conversion is essentially the same.

## The Alchemy of Traffic

Following this framework, many seemingly "unreasonable" phenomena suddenly make sense.

Take the influencer economy. Why can a YouTuber sitting in front of a camera chatting earn millions a year? Because their talent and personal charisma, through the platform's algorithmic systems, get converted into traffic. Traffic is essentially an "aggregation of attention," and attention, mediated by algorithms, can be precisely converted into advertising revenue.

Talent → Content → Algorithmic recommendation → Traffic aggregation → Monetization.

Every step requires electricity and compute as infrastructure. Without servers, without CDNs, without recommendation algorithms, even the most talented person couldn't reach a million viewers.

So influencers aren't getting something for nothing—they're simply converting their knowledge and charisma, through digital channels and computational infrastructure, into currency within this new system. It's fundamentally the same thing as miners using physical labor to dig up gold, or engineers using brainpower to write code: [using some form of energy, through some conversion mechanism, to create socially recognized value](/articles/traffic-beyond-currency).

## What's Your Computational Power?

Back to the personal level.

If computational power is the foundational currency of the new era, then everyone needs to ask themselves a question: How much computational power can I mobilize?

This isn't just about whether you can use ChatGPT. It's about whether you can identify which problems are worth computing, whether you can design effective analytical frameworks, and whether you can distinguish signal from noise in AI's output.

The point was never how much compute you own—GPUs can be rented, APIs can be purchased. The point is whether you have the ability to convert compute into meaningful output.

Just like in the gold standard era, the point wasn't how much gold you had, but whether you could make valuable trades with that gold. The computational power standard era is the same: energy itself isn't valuable—the efficiency of energy conversion is what's valuable.

This is perhaps the most fundamental redefinition of "value" in our time.
