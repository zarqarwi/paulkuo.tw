# The Computation Standard
## When Knowledge, Electricity, and Currency Become Equivalent

Looking at Bitcoin transactions through the lens of energy consumption yields a fascinating insight.
Electrical energy, through computational power, becomes linked to the monetary system.

This turns the relationship between "electricity, computation, and currency" into something resembling a system of simultaneous equations.

## Brainpower Equals Algorithm

With the rise of AI, knowledge has also entered the quantified logic of computation.

Following this reasoning: knowledge, too, is a form of algorithm.

Since it's an algorithm, knowledge can potentially be mathematized and quantified.
What we call the "knowledge economy" can now be more clearly linked to currency.

Solving problems at the highest level, creating systems through entrepreneurship—these are valuable because the "computational power" required behind them is extraordinarily strong.

## From the Gold Standard to the Energy Standard

In contrast to the traditional "gold standard" and "dollar standard," an "energy standard" may be a more fitting metric for the digital technology era.

In other words: "computational power" is a new standard of value and price.

Capital can purchase electricity. Capital can intervene in algorithms through electricity to acquire core knowledge. Conversely, individuals who possess critical knowledge can reverse-engineer the potential for generating returns.

## Conclusion: The Alchemy of Traffic

Extending this reasoning, the "influencer phenomenon" becomes easy to understand.

An influencer's talent, channeled through the internet's algorithmic platforms, aggregates traffic.
Through the intrinsic relationship between traffic and computational power, this is converted into currency under the "energy standard," then funneled into the familiar dollar-based system.

The point has never been scale.
It's always been about the efficiency of conversion and computational power.
