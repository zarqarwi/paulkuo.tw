title: "The Age of Computational Standard: When Knowledge, Electricity, and Currency Become Equivalent"
description: "Digital currencies reveal the interconnected relationship between electricity, computation, and money. When knowledge can be mathematized and linked to currency, we enter a new economic model where computational power serves as the standard of value."

## The Age of Computational Standard
### When Knowledge, Electricity, and Currency Become Equivalent

Examining Bitcoin transactions from an energy consumption perspective yields fascinating insights.
Electrical energy, through computational power, becomes linked to monetary systems.

This transforms the relationship between "electricity, computation, and currency"
into a kind of linear equation with binary elements.

### Brainpower Equals Algorithm

With the rise of AI, knowledge has also entered the computational logic of quantification.

Following this reasoning:
Knowledge is also a form of algorithm.

Since it's algorithmic, knowledge has the potential to be mathematized and quantified.
The "knowledge economy" we speak of can be more clearly linked to currency.

The value of problem-solving sophistication and system-creating entrepreneurship
stems from the enormously powerful "computational force" required behind them.

### From Gold Standard to Energy Standard

Compared to traditional "gold standard" and "dollar standard,"
an "energy standard" might be a more fitting value assessment criterion for digital technology.

In other words:
"Computational power" represents a new standard of value and pricing.

Capital can purchase electricity.
Capital intervenes in algorithms through electricity to acquire core knowledge.
Conversely, individuals possessing critical knowledge can also reverse-engineer possibilities for generating revenue.

### Conclusion: The Alchemy of Traffic

Following this line of reasoning, the "influencer phenomenon" becomes readily comprehensible.

Influencers' talents, channeled through internet algorithmic platforms, aggregate traffic.
Through the intrinsic relationship between traffic and computational power, this converts into "energy standard" currency, then transfers into the familiar dollar-standard system.

Commerce seeks boundless reach.
Commerce seeks more efficient conversion.

The key has never been scale.
Rather, it's the conversion between efficiency and computational power.
