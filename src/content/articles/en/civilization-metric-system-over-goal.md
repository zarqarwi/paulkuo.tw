title: "The Overlooked Indicator of Civilization: A Risk Philosophy of Replacing 'Goals' with 'Systems'"
description: "Civilizational progress cannot be measured solely by economic growth or productivity. 'Risk reduction' that provides security is equally central to civilization. At the personal level, happiness should not be judged only by wealth accumulation, but requires evaluating risk costs and time allocation. Building a continuously operating, meaningful life 'system' leads to true success far more than merely pursuing finite 'goals.'"

## The Overlooked Indicator of Civilization
### A Risk Philosophy of Replacing "Goals" with "Systems"

Let's discuss civilizational progress.
The standard most familiar to economists is GDP or per capita income.
This is a form of "productivism": focusing only on the contribution of economic activity.

Under this logic, knowledge is ruthlessly divided into two categories:
- Useful knowledge: technology, business, law, because they can promote production.
- Useless knowledge: humanities, philosophy, religion, because they seemingly cannot directly create wealth.

But Professor Chen Zhiwu points out in "The Logic of Civilization" that this classification is fundamentally wrong.

### Risk Reduction is Also a Form of Civilization

Civilization is not just equivalent to wealth growth.
Civilization also encompasses "risk reduction."

From a historical perspective, risk is the primary source of violence.
Religions and belief systems may not be able to directly print money, but they increase humanity's capacity to cope with risk and provide security. This is completely consistent with investment theory's logic of "not just looking at returns, but also at risk."

When we become overly dependent on petrochemical civilization, leading to climate anomalies and a fragile world.
We are at a turning point where we must rethink our life paradigms.

### Personal Happiness Systems

Pulling back from macro civilization to the personal level.
Measuring happiness absolutely cannot focus only on the Dollar Sign.

Happiness = (Wealth + Health + Life Events) × Time × Risk Management.

How do you allocate your living time?
Do you engage in interesting activities, read inspiring books, spend time with loved ones?
The power of spirit and culture gives us the resilience to bear hardship.

### Conclusion: Goals Belong to Losers, Systems Belong to Winners

The creator of "Dilbert" once said: Goals are for losers, systems are for winners.

Pursuing "goals" is like a race with a finish line.
When you reach the finish line, it's either success or failure.

But "systems" have no deadline.
When you do what you want to do every day, operating this system with full energy.
Eventually, this system will automatically lead you toward progress and true happiness.
