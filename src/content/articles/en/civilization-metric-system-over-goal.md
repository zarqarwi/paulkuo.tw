title: "The Overlooked Indicator of Civilization: A Risk Philosophy of Replacing 'Goals' with 'Systems'"
description: "Civilizational progress cannot be measured solely by economic growth or productivity; 'reducing risk' to provide security is equally central to civilization. At the personal level, happiness should not be judged merely by wealth accumulation, but by evaluating risk costs and time allocation. Building a continuously operating life 'system' that brings meaning leads to genuine success far more than simply chasing finite 'goals'."

## The Overlooked Indicator of Civilization
### A Risk Philosophy of Replacing 'Goals' with 'Systems'

When measuring the progress of civilization, economists have traditionally relied on GDP or per capita income. This is a "productivity-only" approach: judging value solely by economic output.

Under this logic, knowledge is ruthlessly divided into two categories:
- **Useful knowledge**: Technology, business, law — because they boost production.
- **Useless knowledge**: Humanities, philosophy, religion — because they don't directly create wealth.

But as Professor Chen Zhiwu argues in *The Logic of Civilization*, this categorization is profoundly wrong.

### Risk Reduction Is Also Civilization

Civilization is not only about the growth of wealth. It also encompasses the **reduction of risk**.

Historically, risk is the primary driver of violence. Religious and belief systems may not directly print money, but they increase humanity's capacity to cope with risk and provide a sense of security. This aligns perfectly with investment theory: "Don't just look at returns — look at risk."

As we've become overly dependent on fossil fuel civilization, causing climate anomalies and global fragility, we stand at a turning point where we must rethink our paradigms.

### A Personal System for Happiness

Bringing this back from macro civilization to the personal level: Measuring happiness absolutely cannot rely on the Dollar Sign alone.

**Happiness = (Wealth + Health + Life Events) × Time × Risk Management.**

How do you allocate your living time? Are you engaged in interesting activities, reading inspiring books, spending time with loved ones? The power of spirit and culture gives us the resilience to endure hardship.

### Conclusion: Goals Are for Losers, Systems Are for Winners

Scott Adams, creator of *Dilbert*, once said: Goals are for losers; systems are for winners.

Chasing "goals" is like a race with a finish line. When you reach the end, it's either success or failure.

But a "system" has no deadline. When you spend every day doing what you want to do, energetically operating this system, one day it will automatically carry you toward progress and genuine happiness.
