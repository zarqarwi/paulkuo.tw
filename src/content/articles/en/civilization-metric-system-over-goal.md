title: "The Overlooked Metric of Civilization: A Risk Philosophy of Replacing 'Goals' with 'Systems'"
description: "The progress of civilization cannot be measured solely by economic growth or productivity. 'Risk reduction' to provide security is equally central to civilization. At the individual level, happiness should not only look at wealth accumulation, but must assess the cost of risk and allocation of time. Building a continuously operating, meaningful life 'system' leads to genuine success far more than simply chasing finite 'goals'."

## The Overlooked Metric of Civilization
### A Risk Philosophy of Replacing 'Goals' with 'Systems'

Let's discuss the progress of civilization.
The standard most familiar to economists is GDP or per capita income.
This is a form of "productivism": only looking at the contribution of economic activities.

Under this logic, knowledge is ruthlessly divided into two categories:
- Useful knowledge: technology, business, law, because they can promote production.
- Useless knowledge: humanities, philosophy, religion, because they seemingly cannot directly create wealth.

But Professor Chen Zhiwu points out in *The Logic of Civilization* that this classification is completely wrong.

### Risk Reduction Is Also a Form of Civilization

Civilization doesn't only equal the growth of wealth.
Civilization also includes the "reduction of risk."

From a historical perspective, risk is the primary cause of violence.
Religion and belief systems may not be able to directly print money, but they increase humanity's ability to cope with risk and provide a sense of security. This is completely consistent with investment theory's logic that "you cannot only look at returns, but must also consider risk."

When we over-rely on fossil fuel civilization, leading to climate anomalies and making the world fragile.
We are at a turning point where we must rethink our life paradigms.

### Personal Happiness Systems

Pulling back from macro civilization to the individual level.
When measuring happiness, we absolutely cannot only look at the dollar sign.

Happiness = (Wealth + Health + Life Events) × Time × Risk Management.

How do you allocate your living time?
Are you engaging in interesting activities, reading inspiring books, spending time with loved ones?
The power of spirit and culture is what gives us the resilience to bear hardships.

### Conclusion: Goals Are for Losers, Systems Are for Winners

The author of *Dilbert* once said: goals are for losers, systems are for winners.

Chasing "goals" is like a race with a finish line.
When you reach the finish line, it's either success or failure.

But "systems" have no deadline.
When you're doing what you want to do every day, operating this system with full energy.
Eventually, this system will automatically lead you toward progress and true happiness.
