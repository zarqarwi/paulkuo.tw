title: "The Burnout Society: 'Can't Keep Up, Can't Lie Down' in the Self-Exploitation of Meritocracy"
description: "In 'meritocratic society,' we are no longer oppressed by external authority, but have become 'free laborers' engaging in self-exploitation.

We lose our capacity for silence and contemplation in the anxiety of 'must be better.' Reclaiming the courage to be 'bored' and re-sensing the world in emptiness is the true starting point for resisting this violence of positivity."

We are living in a "meritocratic society." Everyone has become an individual engaging in self-exploitation. People are no longer subject to commands from external authority, but have become "free laborers" who engage in self-monitoring and self-motivation. Those voices saying "must be better" are the spiritual noise of our entire era.

## The Shackles of Being Seen

Byung-Chul Han points out that in meritocratic society, people constantly display themselves, seeking to be seen and affirmed. This is a new form of control. People are both performers and audiences, packaging themselves as commodities displayed under the gaze of others.

Rest and relaxation also become performances. If relaxation doesn't express elegance and quality on social media, it becomes slackness. In the cycle of "being seen, being liked, being followed," we keep ourselves incredibly busy while falling into deep emptiness.

## The Illusion of Efficiency and Freedom

In such a structure, "self-management" also becomes a tool of internal friction. For example, the "Pomodoro Technique"—each ring becomes a command to monitor oneself to be more efficient. People think they are managing time, but are actually being managed by time.

This self-exploitation is packaged as self-realization. We are trapped by the illusion of "freedom," falling into an infinite loop of self-optimization, deeply afraid of becoming "small cogs in the chain of contempt."

## Conclusion: Reclaiming the Courage to Be "Bored"

In meritocratic society, everyone is forced to "constantly produce, constantly act," becoming anxious the moment they stop. But Han believes: boredom is a gateway to contemplation and the birth of new things.

When everything is filled up, we lose not only our listening, but also our thinking. Freedom lies not in being able to do more, but in being able to stop. Re-generating desire and re-sensing the world in emptiness and silence is the true beginning of resisting burnout.
