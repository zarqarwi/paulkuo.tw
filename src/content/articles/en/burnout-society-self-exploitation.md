title: "The Burnout Society: 'Can't Hustle, Can't Lie Flat' in the Self-Exploitation of Meritocracy"
description: "In the 'achievement society,' we are no longer oppressed by external authority but have become 'free laborers' trapped in self-exploitation. In the torrent of pursuing efficiency and visibility, rest has become a performance, and self-management has become a tool of internal exhaustion. We lose our capacity for silence and contemplation in the anxiety of 'must be better.' Reclaiming the courage to be 'bored' and rediscovering the world in emptiness is the true starting point for resisting this violence of positivity."

We are living in an "achievement society." Everyone has become an agent of self-exploitation. People are no longer subject to commands from external authority, but have become "free laborers" who self-monitor and self-motivate. Those voices saying "you must be better" are the spiritual noise of our entire era.

## The Shackles of Being Seen

Byung-Chul Han points out that in the achievement society, people constantly display themselves, seeking to be seen and affirmed. This is a new form of control. People are both performers and audience, packaging themselves as commodities displayed under others' gaze.

Even rest and relaxation become performances. If relaxation doesn't express elegance and quality on social media, it becomes slackness. In the cycle of "being seen, being liked, being followed," we make ourselves incredibly busy yet remain deeply empty.

## The Illusion of Efficiency and Freedom

Within this structure, "self-management" also becomes a tool of internal exhaustion. Take the "Pomodoro Technique," for example—each ring becomes a command to make ourselves more efficient, a form of surveillance. We think we're managing time, but in reality, we're being managed by time.

This self-exploitation is packaged as self-realization. We are trapped by the illusion of "freedom," caught in endless loops of self-optimization, deeply afraid of becoming "small cogs in the chain of contempt."

## Conclusion: Reclaiming the Courage to Be "Bored"

In the achievement society, everyone is forced to "constantly produce, constantly act"—anxiety strikes the moment we stop. But Han believes: boredom is a gateway to contemplation and the birth of new things.

When everything is filled up, we lose not only our ability to listen but also our capacity to think. Freedom lies not in being able to do more, but in being able to stop. Regenerating desire and rediscovering the world in emptiness and silence—this is where the real resistance to burnout begins.
