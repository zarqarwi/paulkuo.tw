title: "The Duel Between System and Intuition: Cognitive Construction Behind Business Planning"
description: "Human cognition operates through intuitive 'System 1' and rational 'System 2.' In guiding students to construct business websites, the greatest challenge is leading them to break free from effortless intuition and enter the highly demanding realm of rational systematic analysis. The birth of a business website is never merely stacking empty pages—it must begin with business purpose, systematizing fragmented daily operations through technological tools. This is not just a display of technical prowess, but a psychological art of clarifying 'who we are' and 'what we provide.'"

## The Duel Between System and Intuition
### Cognitive Construction Behind Business Planning

In leading the summer project for the Entrepreneurial Spirit class,
I introduced students to "dual-process theory."

This explains the two modes of human cognitive processing:
- System 1: Intuitive, fast, effortless.
- System 2: Rational, slow, highly demanding.

I wanted them to understand that the upcoming project would be a high-intensity activity requiring System 2 activation.

### The Underlying Logic of Business Websites

Four days into the project,
the websites students have created currently contain only one page with virtually empty content.

I must clarify the project's objectives once again:
We are not creating school reports, but rather "operationally viable business websites."

This must be based on past sales experience, product copy, and customer interactions, systematically presenting information through technological tools.
Only by establishing systematic solutions can we eliminate fragmented manual work.

### Reverse Engineering from Purpose to Content

Every website has its core mission.
Educational websites provide knowledge, news websites deliver reports, and our goal is business conversion.

Therefore, when considering website content, we must first begin with "purpose," then reverse engineer the needs of operators and users.

The key propositions that the frontend must clearly address include:
- Who are we?
- What products or services do we provide?
- What does the product look like? What makes it attractive?
- How do we plan to sell? How should consumers make purchases?

### Conclusion

Transforming these business logics into clear pages
is both a psychological art and a technical discipline.

It requires profound editorial capability as well as solid technological foundation.
This is why teams must collaborate through division of labor, collectively activating the demanding System 2, to transform intangible ideas into concrete business force.
