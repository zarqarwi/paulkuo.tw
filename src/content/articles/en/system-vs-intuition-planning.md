title: "Systems vs. Intuition: Cognitive Construction Behind Business Planning"
description: "Human cognition operates through intuitive 'System 1' and rational 'System 2.' When guiding students to construct business websites, the greatest challenge is leading them beyond effortless intuition into the highly demanding rational system analysis. A business website is never merely a stack of empty pages—it must begin with commercial purpose, systematizing fragmented daily work through technological tools. This is not only a demonstration of technical capability, but also the psychological artistry of clarifying 'who we are' and 'what we provide.'"

# Systems vs. Intuition
## Cognitive Construction Behind Business Planning

In leading the summer project for the entrepreneurial spirit recognition class,
I introduced students to "dual-process theory."

This explains two modes of human cognitive operation:
- System 1: Intuitive, fast, effortless.
- System 2: Rational, slow, highly demanding.

I wanted them to understand that the upcoming project would be a high-tension activity requiring System 2 activation.

## The Foundational Logic of Business Websites

Four days into the project,
the websites students have created currently contain only one page with virtually empty content.

I must once again clarify the project's objective:
We are not creating a school report, but rather building a "commercially viable website."

This must be based on past sales experience, product copy, and customer interactions, systematically presenting information through technological tools.
Only by establishing systematic solutions can we eliminate fragmented manual work.

## Reverse Engineering Content from Purpose

Every website has its core mission.
Educational websites provide knowledge, news websites deliver reports, while our goal is commercial conversion.

Therefore, when considering website content, we must first begin with "purpose," then reverse engineer the needs of operators and users.

Key propositions that the frontend must clearly address include:
- Who are we?
- What products or services do we provide?
- What do our products look like? What is their appeal?
- How do we plan to sell? How should consumers make purchases?

## Conclusion

Transforming these business logics into clear pages
is both a psychological art and a technical discipline.

It requires both profound editorial capability and solid technological support.
This is why teams must collaborate through division of labor, collectively activating the demanding System 2, to transform ethereal ideas into concrete commercial power.
