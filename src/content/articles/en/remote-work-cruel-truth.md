title: "The Cruel Truth About Remote Work: Online Collaboration That Tests Human Nature"
description: "The pandemic forced many teams to taste remote work for the first time, but most people mistakenly treat 'flexibility' as an excuse for 'lack of discipline.' Online collaboration not only fails to eliminate the necessity of management, but more nakedly tests human laziness. Remote work without clear milestones, project breakdown, and task assignments will ultimately devolve into a game of 'pretending to be productive.' Don't underestimate human nature—only extremely rigorous management can support seemingly free online operations."

## The Cruel Truth About Remote Work

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread.
Many companies have been forced to experiment with online work and team operations for the first time.

Online work can indeed transcend geographical barriers.
But it also has extremely fatal flaws.

### A Thousand Ways to Slack Off

Ten years ago, I participated in a publishing project completed through online collaboration.
The team was scattered across the globe, making online work the only option.

After three years of real combat experience, I gained a profound insight:
I had completely mastered a thousand ways to slack off in remote work.

- How to appear very diligent while actually slacking off?
- How to speak earnestly and say nothing while producing zero output?
- How to skillfully blame problems on "unstable connection"?
- How to take the company's money while maximizing your personal time?

Put simply, it's about being pretentious with skill, without getting caught.

### Don't Underestimate Human Nature

Some question: isn't remote work supposed to emphasize flexibility and adaptability?
Wouldn't managing too tightly create excessive pressure?

They're not wrong.
But out of a hundred people, fewer than one percent truly have discipline and self-accountability.

Being proactive is human nature.
But wanting to coast through life is an even stronger human nature.

Let's stop pretending to be pure.
Without management, it's managerial negligence.
We're not distrusting people—we simply shouldn't underestimate human nature.

### The Four Pillars of Remote Management

Because I'm so familiar with how to muddle through, the solution isn't difficult.

1. **Work Records:** Daily work content must be documented. Only what's recorded can be managed.
2. **Clear Progress:** Define resources and pace based on objectives, establishing checkpoints.
3. **Minimize Projects:** The smaller the project, the less ambiguous space. Clearly communicate what needs to be completed within a given timeframe.
4. **Flexible Assignment:** Managers must wisely delegate work, with every meeting resulting in clear deadlines and task assignments.

Everything has a cost.
Freedom and ease must inevitably come with the price of extreme self-discipline.
