title: "The Brutal Truth About Remote Work: Online Collaboration That Tests Human Nature"
description: "The pandemic has forced many teams to taste remote work for the first time, but most people mistake 'flexibility' for an excuse for 'lack of discipline.' Online collaboration not only fails to eliminate the need for management—it more nakedly exposes the laziness of human nature. Remote work without clear milestones, project segmentation, and task assignment will ultimately devolve into a game of 'pretending to be productive.' Don't underestimate human nature—only extremely rigorous management can support what appears to be free online operations."

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread.
Many companies have been forced to try online work and team operations for the first time.

Online work can indeed transcend geographical barriers.
But it also has extremely fatal flaws.

### A Thousand Ways to Slack Off

Ten years ago, I participated in a publishing project completed through online collaboration.
The team was scattered around the world—online was the only option.

After three years of real combat experience, I gained a profound insight:
I had completely mastered a thousand ways to slack off in online work.

- How to look very serious while actually slacking?
- How to speak earnestly but produce nothing?
- How to skillfully blame problems on "unstable connection"?
- How to take the company's money while maximizing your personal time?

In short, it's about being pretentious with skill, without getting caught.

### Don't Underestimate Human Nature

Some question: isn't remote work supposed to emphasize flexibility and adaptability?
Wouldn't managing too tightly be too high-pressure?

That's not wrong.
But out of a hundred people, fewer than one percent truly have discipline and self-demand.

Being proactive is human nature.
But wanting to coast through life is an even stronger human nature.

Let's stop pretending to be pure.
Without management, it's managerial negligence.
We're not distrusting people—we simply shouldn't underestimate human nature.

### The Four Pillars of Remote Management

Because I'm so familiar with how to muddle through, the solution isn't difficult.

1. **Work Records:** Daily work content must be documented—only what's recorded can be managed.
2. **Clear Progress:** Define resources and pace based on objectives, establish checkpoints.
3. **Project Minimization:** The smaller the project, the less ambiguous space. Clearly communicate what needs to be completed in this timeframe.
4. **Flexible Assignment:** Managers must wisely divide work—every meeting must result in clear deadlines and task assignments.

Everything has a cost.
Freedom and ease must be accompanied by the price of extreme self-discipline.
