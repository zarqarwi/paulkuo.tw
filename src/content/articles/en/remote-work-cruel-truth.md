title: "The Harsh Reality of Remote Work: Online Collaboration That Tests Human Nature"
description: "The pandemic has forced many teams to taste remote work for the first time, but most people mistake 'flexibility' for an excuse for 'indiscipline.' Online collaboration not only fails to eliminate the necessity of management—it more nakedly tests the laziness inherent in human nature. Remote work without clear progress milestones, project breakdown, and task assignments will ultimately devolve into a game of 'pretending to work hard' that spins its wheels. Don't underestimate human nature—only extremely rigorous management can support the seemingly free operation of online work."

## The Harsh Reality of Remote Work
### Online Collaboration That Tests Human Nature

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread.
Many companies have been forced to try online work and team operations for the first time.

Online work can indeed transcend geographical barriers.
But it also has extremely fatal flaws.

### A Thousand Ways to Slack Off

Ten years ago, I participated in a publishing project completed through online collaborative work.
The team was scattered around the world, making online work the only option.

After three years of real combat experience, I gained a profound insight:
I had completely mastered a thousand ways to slack off in online work.

- How to look very serious while actually slacking off?
- How to speak earnestly and say nonsense while producing nothing?
- How to skillfully blame problems on "unstable connection"?
- How to take the company's money while maximizing your personal time?

Put simply: how to be pretentious with skill and not get caught.

### Don't Underestimate Human Nature

Some question: isn't online work supposed to emphasize flexibility and agility?
Wouldn't managing too tightly create too much pressure?

That's not wrong.
But out of a hundred people, fewer than one percent truly have discipline and self-discipline.

Being proactive is human nature.
But wanting to coast through life is an even stronger human nature.

Let's stop pretending to be pure.
Without management, it's managerial negligence.
We're not distrusting people—we simply shouldn't underestimate human nature.

### The Four Pillars of Remote Management

Because I'm too familiar with how to muddle through, the solution isn't difficult.

1. **Work Documentation:** Daily work content must be recorded. Only what's recorded can be managed.
2. **Clear Progress:** Define resources and pace based on objectives, establish checkpoints.
3. **Project Minimization:** The smaller the project, the smaller the ambiguous space. Clearly communicate what needs to be completed during this period.
4. **Flexible Assignment:** Managers must wisely divide work, with clear deadlines and task assignments after every meeting.

Everything has a cost.
Freedom and ease must be accompanied by the price of extreme self-discipline.
