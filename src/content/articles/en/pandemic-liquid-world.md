## The Liquid World Revealed by the Pandemic

The pandemic is not an interruption.
It is a mirror.

It shows us that
the world we thought was solid
has long been liquid.

### Bauman's Prophecy

Sociologist Zygmunt Bauman proposed the concept of "liquid modernity" twenty years ago.

He said:
In modern society, all solid things—institutions, relationships, work—
are rapidly melting, flowing.

The pandemic has only accelerated this process.

### The Liquefaction of Work

Your office can be at home, in a coffee shop, anywhere.
Your colleagues might be in different time zones.
Your company might restructure tomorrow.

The concept of "stable employment"
no longer exists in the liquid world.

### The Liquefaction of Relationships

Social media makes interpersonal relationships easier to establish,
and easier to break.

We have hundreds of "friends,"
but when we need help,
fewer and fewer people we can actually call.

### Conclusion

The liquid world isn't a question of good or bad.
It's reality.

The question is:
In a world where everything is in flux,
what will you anchor yourself to?
