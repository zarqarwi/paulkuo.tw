## Pandemic Revelation
### We Live in a Liquid World

The pandemic has shown us that everything we once took for granted—borders, flights, going to work, gatherings—is actually fragile.

Sociologist Zygmunt Bauman warned us long ago: the essence of modern society is "liquid."
Nothing is fixed. Work, relationships, identity—all are in flux.

The pandemic has simply made this truth impossible to ignore.

When the world reopens, we shouldn't rush back to the old order.
Instead, with this newfound clarity, we should reconsider: what is truly worth holding onto?
