title: "Pandemic Revelation: We Live in a Liquid World"
subtitle: "Zygmunt Bauman predicted this twenty years ago, before borders, flights, and gatherings evaporated overnight"
description: "The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic forced the world to suddenly experience what sociologist Zygmunt Bauman called 'liquid modernity.' The things we thought were solid—borders, flights, work, everyday gatherings—turned out to be anything but. They were always liquid; we simply chose to ignore it selectively. The pandemic didn't create uncertainty; it merely tore away the wrapping paper of certainty. When the world reopens, the question is not 'how do we go back,' but rather 'where do we go from here, with this clarity?'"
abstract: |
  When Zygmunt Bauman introduced "Liquid Modernity" in 2000, most people saw it as academic rhetoric. Twenty years later, COVID-19 proved him right in the cruelest way. Paul begins from his experience watching my team shift entirely remote during the pandemic and discovers that "liquid" is not merely a description of social structures, but a metaphor for personal survival. Those things assumed to be solid—client relationships, revenue streams, team cohesion—became completely liquid within three weeks of lockdown. This article is neither nostalgia nor critique; it's an invitation to "move forward with clarity."

On a morning in March 2020, I sat at my desk at home with my laptop open. On the screen was a Google Meet window with my team—each person in their own home, various backgrounds, a cat passing by one person's camera, a child crying in the distance behind another.

The week before, we had been meeting in the office, discussing second-quarter client proposals. The week before that, confirmed cases in Taiwan had just started rising, but most people still thought "it probably won't be that serious."

Then everything changed.

Not gradually. All at once. Flights stopped, borders closed, gatherings were canceled, offices emptied. The life structure you took for granted yesterday evaporated completely today.

It was only later that I remembered Zygmunt Bauman.

This Polish-British sociologist published "Liquid Modernity" in 2000, proposing what sounded like an academic argument at the time: the essence of modern society is "liquid." Work is liquid—your position can be restructured, outsourced, or eliminated at any moment. Relationships are liquid—social media makes connection easy, and so does disconnection. Identity is liquid—you are no longer defined by birthplace, class, or profession, but you are therefore always searching for definition.

Bauman contrasted "liquid" with "solid" modernity. Solid modernity was a product of the industrial age—stable employment, clear class structures, predictable life trajectories. You joined a company, worked for thirty years, retired, and collected your pension. The path was clear; the structure was solid.

But from the end of the twentieth century onward, these solid structures melted one after another. Lifetime employment disappeared, marriage was no longer the only form of relationship, and national boundaries were penetrated by globalization. Bauman said we didn't enter a "new stability," but rather an "eternal instability."

Reading this in 2000, you might have thought it was intellectualist pessimism. Reading it again in 2020, you'd think he was being too polite.

What the pandemic did was not shatter a solid world.

It tore away the illusion that "this world is solid."

My experience at the company I was running was very concrete. Before the pandemic, a large part of our business model relied on face-to-face workshops and on-site consulting services. Clients felt they were getting results only when they "saw people," and we felt we were delivering value only when we "showed up." This wasn't just an operational model; it was an entire belief system about what constitutes "effective work."

By mid-March, everything was forced online.

The first week was chaos. Workshops moved to Zoom; clients weren't used to it, and neither were we. Interaction quality declined, rhythm was disrupted, some clients directly paused projects, saying "let's revisit this after the pandemic passes."

The second week was anxiety. Revenue forecasts began to wobble; previously confirmed projects were delayed or canceled. Team members started asking: "How long will this last?"—no one had an answer.

In the third week, a strange kind of clarity emerged.

I began to realize that the things "interrupted by the pandemic" were never as solid as I thought. Clients paused projects because their commitment to the collaboration was always conditional—conditional on "normal circumstances," and "normal circumstances" itself was an assumption, not a fact.

The client relationships we thought were solid were actually liquid. The revenue streams we thought were stable were actually liquid. The work methods we thought were unchanging were actually liquid.

Bauman was right. Everything is liquid. It just happens that normal temperatures make it look solid.

But liquid doesn't mean fragile. This is the most important lesson I learned during the pandemic.

Water is liquid, but water can wear through stone. Water has no fixed shape, but it can fill any container. The essence of liquidity is not "instability" but "adaptability."

In the later stages of the pandemic, our team gradually found a new work rhythm. The format of online workshops was redesigned—not by transferring face-to-face processes to screens, but by rethinking interaction logic for online environments. Some clients even discovered that online efficiency was higher, eliminating travel time and making cross-geographical collaboration easier.

My own writing also found a new rhythm during the pandemic. Confined at home with fewer social distractions, I had more time for thinking and writing. The early versions of some articles on this site were written during that period of "forced stillness" in 2020.

This is not glorifying the pandemic. The pandemic caused real suffering, death, and economic loss that should never be offset by any positive narrative.

But in acknowledging that suffering, I also cannot deny a fact: the time spent confronting the liquid reality taught me things I could never have learned within the "solid illusion."

In a later-life interview, Bauman said something that struck me deeply. He said the greatest risk of liquid modernity is not instability itself, but people grasping for anything that looks like "certainty" to escape instability—populism, extremist ideologies, simple binary narratives.

The world after 2020 perfectly verified this prediction. The pandemic spawned conspiracy theories, anti-science movements, and political polarization. People don't fail to recognize that the world is changing; rather, the anxiety that change brings is so great that they need a "simple answer" to comfort themselves.

But simple answers are never answers. They're another form of solid illusion—and more dangerous than the original, because they're deliberately manufactured.

It is now 2026. The pandemic has faded from most people's daily lives. Flights have resumed, gatherings have returned, offices are full again.

But I have not returned to the state of 2019. I don't want to go back, and I can't anyway.

What the pandemic taught me is simple, but difficult to live out: accept the liquid, but don't be drowned by it.

Don't pretend the world is solid; that's self-deception. Don't abandon all effort because the world is liquid; that's nihilism. Rather, proceed with the clarity that "everything may change," and choose those things worthy of your investment—even if they too are liquid.

Because liquid doesn't mean not worth it. Flowers wilt, but you still plant them. Relationships change, but you still invest in them. Work disappears, but you still work seriously.

The only difference is that you no longer pretend they're eternal. And this refusal to pretend makes you take the present moment more seriously.
