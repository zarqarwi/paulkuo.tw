title: "Approaching Negentropy: Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order in the US-China Competition"
description: "Entropy represents chaos and disintegration, while negentropy represents order and vitality. Business decisions are essentially about 'countering entropy increase.' From an anti-entropy historical perspective, the US-China competition is a contest of 'entropy reduction engineering.' Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides, but rather side with order—actively aligning with stable negative entropy centers in core technology, production layout, and capital regulations, while staying away from chaotic entropy flows. This is the minimum strategy for survival amid change and the prerequisite for creating new opportunities."

## Approaching Negentropy
### Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order in the US-China Competition

When we assess the situation, we speak not of turbulent news, but of structure; not of emotions, but of "entropy."

### Negentropy: The Essence of Survival

In 1944, Schrödinger proposed that life exists because it feeds on "negentropy."
Entropy represents chaos and disintegration; negentropy represents order, structure, and vitality.

Rooms become messy without cleaning; companies decline without innovation. This is entropy increase.
Our daily decisions and strategic layouts are essentially about "countering entropy increase," creating order for the system.

### The US-China Competition Through Anti-Entropy History

Viewing history through an "anti-entropy historical perspective": whoever creates order leads the network's reorganization; whoever falls into chaos becomes the control group.

In semiconductor and biotech industries, the US and China are not merely competing—they are conducting different forms of "entropy reduction engineering."
- **US System**: Controls technology, institutions, and supply chain division of labor, currently serving as the "negative entropy center."
- **China System**: Attempting to establish its own order, but still in a phase of catching up and transformation, bearing enormous "entropy increase pressure."

### Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order

Order is risk mitigation.
Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides, but rather "side with order."

1. **Core Technology**: Align with the institutionally stable US-Japan-Europe system.
2. **China Market**: Participation is acceptable, but avoid overexposure and maintain readiness to withdraw.
3. **Production Layout**: Dual-base principle, supply chain decentralization.
4. **Capital Compliance**: Focus primarily on international capital markets for financing.

Simply put: approach the side of order, distance from the end of chaos.

### Conclusion: Be a Force Against Entropy Increase

When making decisions and choosing partners, ask yourself: Is this creating order or consuming energy?

Those who counter entropy increase can stabilize environments and make people feel secure.
Choosing to approach the world of negentropy is both a disposition and the minimum strategy for maintaining formation amid turbulence.

Chaos leads to degradation, while order enables longevity.
