title: "Approaching Negentropy: Taiwan Enterprise's Choice of Order in the US-China Game"
description: "Entropy represents chaos and disintegration, while negentropy embodies order and vitality. Enterprise decisions are essentially about 'countering entropy increase.' From an anti-entropy historical perspective, the US-China competition is a race of 'entropy reduction engineering.' Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides but rather choose the side of order—actively aligning with stable institutional negentropy centers in core technology, production layout, and capital regulations, while distancing from chaotic entropy flows. This is the minimum strategy for survival in turbulent times and the prerequisite for creating new opportunities."

## Approaching Negentropy
### Taiwan Enterprise's Choice of Order in the US-China Game

When we assess the situation, we're not discussing the noise of daily news, but structure; not emotions, but "entropy."

### Negentropy: The Essence of Survival

In 1944, Schrödinger proposed: life exists because it absorbs "negentropy."
Entropy represents chaos and disintegration; negentropy represents order, structure, and vitality.

A room becomes messy without cleaning; enterprises decline without innovation. This is entropy increase.
Our daily decisions and strategies are essentially about "countering entropy increase," creating order for the system.

### The US-China Game Through Anti-Entropy Historical Perspective

Viewing history through an "anti-entropy historical perspective": whoever creates order can lead network reorganization; whoever falls into chaos becomes the control group.

In semiconductor and biotech industries, the US and China are not merely competing—they are conducting different forms of "entropy reduction engineering."
- **The US System**: Controls technology, institutions, and supply chain division of labor, currently serving as the "negentropy center."
- **The Chinese System**: Attempting to establish its own order, but still in a phase of catching up and transformation, bearing enormous "entropy increase pressure."

### Taiwan Enterprise's Choice of Order

Order is risk hedging.
Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides, but rather "choose the side of order."

1. **Core Technology**: Align with the institutionally stable US-Japan-Europe system.
2. **Chinese Market**: Participation is possible, but avoid overexposure; be ready to exit at any time.
3. **Production Layout**: Dual-base principle, supply chain decentralization.
4. **Capital Compliance**: Focus on international capital markets as primary financing targets.

Simply put: approach the side of order, distance from the end of chaos.

### Conclusion: Become a Force of Anti-Entropy

When making decisions and choosing partners, ask yourself: is this creating order or consuming energy?

Anti-entropy people can stabilize environments and make others feel secure.
Choosing to approach the world of negentropy is both a temperament and the minimum strategy for maintaining formation in turbulence.

Chaos leads to degradation, while order enables longevity.
