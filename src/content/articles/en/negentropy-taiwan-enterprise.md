title: "Approaching Negentropy: Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order in the US-China Competition"
description: "Entropy represents chaos and disintegration, while negentropy represents order and vitality. Corporate decisions are essentially about 'opposing entropy increase.' From an anti-entropy historical perspective, the US-China competition is a contest of 'entropy reduction engineering.' Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides, but rather choose the side of order—actively aligning with stable institutional negentropy centers in core technology, production layout, and capital regulations, while staying away from chaotic entropy flows. This is the minimum strategy for survival amid change and the prerequisite for creating new opportunities."

# Approaching Negentropy
## Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order in the US-China Competition

When we assess situations, we're not talking about chaotic news, but structure; not emotions, but "entropy."

## Negentropy: The Essence of Survival

In 1944, Schrödinger proposed: life exists because it absorbs "negentropy."
Entropy represents chaos and disintegration; negentropy represents order, structure, and vitality.

Rooms become messy without cleaning, enterprises decline without innovation. This is entropy increase.
Our daily decisions and strategies are essentially about "opposing entropy increase," creating order for the system.

## The US-China Competition Through Anti-Entropy Historical Lens

Viewing history through an "anti-entropy historical perspective": whoever creates order dominates network restructuring; whoever falls into chaos becomes the control group.

In semiconductor and biotech industries, the US and China are not just competing—they're conducting different forms of "entropy reduction engineering."
- **US System**: Controls technology, institutions, and supply chain division of labor, currently the "negentropy center."
- **China System**: Attempting to establish its own order, but still in a catch-up and transformation period, bearing enormous "entropy increase pressure."

## Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order

Order equals risk hedging.
Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides, but should "choose the side of order."

1. **Core Technology**: Align with the institutionally stable US-Japan-Europe system.
2. **China Market**: Participation possible, but avoid overexposure, be ready to exit anytime.
3. **Production Layout**: Dual-base principle, supply chain decentralization.
4. **Capital Compliance**: Focus on international capital markets as primary financing targets.

Simply put: approach the side of order, stay away from the chaotic end.

## Conclusion: Be a Force of Anti-Entropy

When making decisions and choosing partners, ask yourself: is this creating order or consuming energy?

Anti-entropy people stabilize environments and make others feel secure.
Choosing to approach the world of negentropy is both an attitude and the minimum strategy for maintaining formation amid turbulence.

Chaos makes people degenerate, while order helps people live longer.
