title: "Approaching Negentropy: Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order in the Context of US-China Competition"
description: "Entropy represents chaos and decay, while negentropy represents order and vitality. Enterprise decisions are essentially about 'combating entropy increase.' From an anti-entropy historical perspective, the US-China competition is a race of 'entropy reduction engineering.' Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides, but rather choose the side of order, actively aligning with negative entropy centers of institutional stability in core technology, production layout, and capital regulations, while staying away from chaotic entropy flows. This is the minimum strategy for survival in turbulent times and the prerequisite for creating new opportunities."

## Approaching Negentropy
### Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order in the Context of US-China Competition

When we assess the situation, we speak not of chaotic news, but of structure; not of emotions, but of "entropy."

### Negentropy: The Essence of Survival

In 1944, Schrödinger proposed that life exists because it absorbs "negentropy."
Entropy represents chaos and decay; negentropy represents order, structure, and vitality.

A room becomes messy without cleaning, enterprises decline without innovation. This is entropy increase.
Our daily decisions and strategic planning are essentially about "combating entropy increase," creating order for the system.

### Viewing US-China Competition Through Anti-Entropy Historical Perspective

Using an "anti-entropy historical perspective" to view history: whoever creates order can dominate network reorganization; whoever falls into chaos becomes the control group.

In the semiconductor and biotechnology industries, the US and China are not merely competing, but engaging in different forms of "entropy reduction engineering."
- **The US System**: Controls technology, institutions, and supply chain division of labor, currently serving as the "negative entropy center."
- **The Chinese System**: Attempts to establish its own order, but remains in a period of catch-up and transformation, bearing enormous "entropy increase pressure."

### Taiwan Enterprises' Choice of Order

Order equals risk hedging.
Taiwan enterprises should not choose political sides, but rather "choose the side of order."

1. **Core Technology**: Align with the institutionally stable US-Japan-Europe system.
2. **Chinese Market**: Participation is acceptable, but avoid overexposure and be ready to exit at any time.
3. **Production Layout**: Dual-base principle, supply chain decentralization.
4. **Capital Compliance**: Focus on international capital markets as the primary financing target.

Simply put: approach the side of order, distance from the end of chaos.

### Conclusion: Be a Force of Anti-Entropy Increase

When making decisions and choosing partners, ask yourself: Is this creating order or consuming energy?

People who practice anti-entropy increase can stabilize environments and make others feel secure.
Choosing to approach the world of negentropy is both a temperament and the minimum strategy for maintaining formation in turbulent times.

Chaos leads to degradation, while order enables longevity.
