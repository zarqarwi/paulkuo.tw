title: "Lessons from Shiseido GIC: Style Transcends Trend"
subtitle: "In Yokohama, I witnessed the confidence of a nearly 150-year-old company — it never chases trends because it is style itself"
description: "At Shiseido's Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Yokohama, I encountered a brand logic fundamentally different from the trend-chasing fashion industry: don't chase trends — define style. Founded in 1872, Shiseido's nearly 150-year survival secret isn't that it bet correctly on every trend, but that it never needed to chase them. This observation holds profound implications for personal branding and corporate strategy alike — in an era where everyone scrambles to follow trends, true competitiveness comes from the thing you don't need to follow."

  During a visit to Shiseido's Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Yokohama, Paul was struck by a single sentence: "We don't chase trends. We pursue style." This wasn't marketing speak — it was the survival philosophy of a nearly 150-year-old company. Trends are externally driven and cyclically obsolescent; style is internally driven and continuously accumulative. Drawing from his brand consulting experience at SDTI, Paul found that the most common mistake Taiwanese companies make is treating "keeping up with trends" as strategy — but trends expire, style doesn't. Starting from the Shiseido case, this essay explores why "who you are" matters far more than "what's trending now."

In the summer of 2019, I stood in the lobby of Shiseido's Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Yokohama's Minato Mirai district, surrounded by meticulously designed exhibition spaces, the air carrying a faint fragrance I couldn't name.

This was Shiseido's R&D base, inaugurated in 2019. The entire building was itself a brand statement. But what truly stopped me in my tracks wasn't the architectural design or the high-tech equipment in the laboratories.

It was something the tour guide said: "Shiseido doesn't chase trends. We pursue style."

At first glance, this sounds like marketing rhetoric — the kind of slogan written on page one of a brand manual that nobody takes seriously.

But after walking through the entire GIC, I realized this wasn't a slogan. It was a methodology.

Shiseido was founded in 1872 — the fifth year of the Meiji era — when Arinobu Fukuhara opened Japan's first Western-style pharmacy in Tokyo's Ginza district. Nearly 150 years later, this company is still alive, and not merely surviving — surviving with a commanding presence. The average lifespan of a Japanese company is roughly 30 years, even shorter globally. A company that survives over a century is already an anomaly; one that does so while maintaining a clear brand identity is an even rarer species.

Why?

The GIC exhibition provided a very concrete clue: Shiseido's history isn't a series of stories about "successfully catching trends," but a series of stories about "insisting on its own aesthetic judgment." From early pharmaceuticals, to postwar cosmetics popularization, to the internationalization of the 1980s, and on to recent tech-beauty innovations — at every stage, Shiseido's strategy was never "what are others doing, let's do that too," but rather "what do we believe beauty should look like."

The difference between trend and style becomes very tangible here.

Trend is externally driven. Its logic is: "Whatever the market wants right now, I'll provide it." This isn't a bad strategy, but it has a structural problem — you're always chasing. Catching up is merely passing; falling behind means elimination. Worse still, trends are cyclically obsolescent — this year's bestseller becomes next year's dead inventory.

Style is internally driven. Its logic is: "I am who I am, so I do what I do." This sounds romantic, but in practice it demands extraordinarily high self-awareness and discipline. Because you must say no at every temptation where "following the trend would make money," and keep going at every moment where "persistence might not pay off."

Shiseido chose the latter. Over nearly 150 years, it hasn't avoided mistakes or detours. But its core logic has never changed: we define beauty — the market doesn't define us.

This reminded me of my experience doing brand consulting at SDTI.

Taiwanese companies — especially SMEs and startups — the most common brand problem isn't "not trying hard enough," but "trying too hard to chase trends."

I've seen too many cases like this: AI is hot this year so they rebrand as "AI-driven," ESG was trending last year so they proclaimed themselves a "sustainability enterprise," NFTs were all the rage the year before that so they launched a "digital collectibles strategy." Every move is proactive, every move responds to the market. But looking back three years later — what exactly is this company?

Everything, and therefore nothing.

I once discussed brand positioning with a client's founder, and he spent forty minutes telling me about all the "industry-first" features his product had. When he finished, I asked one question: "If you strip away all these features, what's left of your brand?"

He froze.

This is the trap of trend-thinking. You think you're building a brand, but you're actually building a feature list tied to trends. When trends shift, the list becomes obsolete.

Back to the Shiseido story.

The GIC has an exhibition section displaying Shiseido's advertisements and product designs across different eras. You can clearly see a single aesthetic thread running through everything — clean, refined, with a kind of restrained elegance. Place a 1920s poster next to a 2019 product package, and remarkably, they don't clash.

This is the power of style. It isn't static — it isn't "looking the same as a hundred years ago." It's an evolving consistency — the underlying aesthetic judgment stays constant, but the means of expression update with the times.

The logic is identical for personal branding.

In running my own content, I constantly face this question. Should an article ride a trending topic? Should a theme chase the algorithm? The answer is almost always no. Not out of snobbery, but because I'm very clear — attention gained by riding trends comes fast and goes fast. The readers who stay are attracted by your perspective and style, not by how quickly you jump on bandwagons.

---

But I must be honest: choosing style over trend comes at a significant cost.

Shiseido can afford this because it has nearly 150 years of accumulated heritage and the scale of a global market. For individuals or small businesses to do the same, what you need isn't courage — it's patience.

Building style is an extremely slow process. You might write articles on the same type of topic for three consecutive years with virtually no change in readership. You might insist on writing long-form while everyone else is doing short-form video. You might have to explain at every brand meeting why you don't plan to follow the latest marketing trend.

Each of these moments is a test.

My own experience is this: the returns on style are delayed, but once established, its moat runs deeper than any trend strategy. Because anyone can chase trends, but only you can define your style. When others are asking "what's trending now," you no longer need to ask — because you are your own trend.

As I left the GIC, the wind off Yokohama harbor was strong.

I recalled a quote I'd read somewhere: "Fashion fades, but style is eternal." This line is usually treated as wardrobe advice, but it's actually a survival strategy.

Whether it's a nearly 150-year-old Japanese company or an individual brand still finding its footing, the logic is the same — you don't need to catch every wave. You just need to know where you want to stand.

The waves will pass. You won't.
