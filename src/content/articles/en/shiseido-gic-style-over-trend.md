# Shiseido GIC's Revelation
## Style Transcends Trends

Last year, I visited Shiseido's Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Yokohama.

From exterior to interior,
the entire building conveys one message:
Beauty isn't put on—it grows from within.

---

## Inside-Out Aesthetics

Shiseido's R&D philosophy is distinctive.

They don't first examine what the market wants, then develop products.
Instead, they first understand the essence of skin, the principles of beauty,
then create from these foundations.

This is "inside-out" logic.
First the roots, then the flowers.

## Style vs Trends

Trends are defined by others.
This year's popular colors, those silhouettes.

Style is self-defined.
Regardless of what's trendy, you know who you are.

The GIC building itself embodies this principle.
It doesn't pursue fashionable design vocabularies,
but speaks in simple, quiet ways.

## Insights for Personal Branding

Building a personal brand works the same way.

Chasing traffic, chasing algorithms—
you're forever on a treadmill.

But if you first establish your own style—
your perspectives, your language, your rhythm—
traffic will come seeking you.

Because what people ultimately remember
isn't trends, but style.

## Conclusion

One thing Shiseido GIC taught me:
Don't ask "What's trending now?"
Ask "What is true?"

What's true naturally develops style.
