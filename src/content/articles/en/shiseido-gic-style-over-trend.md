## Lessons from Shiseido GIC
### Style Over Trend

Last year I visited Shiseido's Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Yokohama.

From exterior to interior,
the entire building conveyed one message:
Beauty isn't put on, it grows from within.

---

### Inside-Out Aesthetics

Shiseido's R&D philosophy is distinctive.

They don't first look at what the market wants, then develop products.
Instead, they first understand the essence of skin, the principles of beauty,
then create from these foundations.

This is an "inside-out" logic.
First the root, then the flower.

### Style vs Trend

Trends are defined by others.
This year's popular colors, those silhouettes.

Style is self-defined.
Regardless of what's trending, you know who you are.

The GIC building itself embodies this philosophy.
It doesn't pursue fashionable design vocabulary,
but speaks in a simple, quiet way.

### Insights for Personal Branding

Personal branding works the same way.

Chasing traffic, chasing algorithms,
you're forever on a treadmill.

But if you first establish your own style—
your perspective, your voice, your rhythm—
traffic will come to find you.

Because what people ultimately remember
is not trends, but style.

### Conclusion

One thing Shiseido GIC taught me:
Don't ask "What's trending?"
Ask "What's true?"

What's true will naturally have style.
