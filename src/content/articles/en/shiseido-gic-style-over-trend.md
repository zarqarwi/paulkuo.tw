## Lessons from Shiseido GIC
### Style Over Trends

Last year I visited Shiseido's Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Yokohama.

From exterior to interior,
the entire building conveys one message:
Beauty isn't put on—it grows from within.

---

### Inside-Out Aesthetics

Shiseido's R&D philosophy is distinctive.

They don't first look at what the market wants, then develop products.
Instead, they first understand the essence of skin, the principles of beauty,
then create from these foundations.

This is "inside-out" logic.
First roots, then flowers.

### Style vs Trends

Trends are defined by others.
This year's popular colors, those silhouettes.

Style is self-defined.
No matter what's trending, you know who you are.

The GIC building itself embodies this principle.
It doesn't pursue fashionable design vocabulary,
but speaks in a simple, quiet way.

### Insights for Personal Branding

Personal branding works the same way.

Chasing traffic, chasing algorithms—
you're forever on a treadmill.

But if you first establish your own style—
your perspective, your voice, your rhythm—
traffic will come find you instead.

Because what people ultimately remember
isn't trends, but style.

### Conclusion

One thing Shiseido GIC taught me:
Don't ask "What's trending now?"
Ask "What is true?"

What's true will naturally have style.
