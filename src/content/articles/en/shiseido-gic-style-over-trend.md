## Lessons from Shiseido GIC
### Style Over Trend

At Shiseido's Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Yokohama,
I witnessed an intriguing brand philosophy.

Shiseido doesn't chase trends. They pursue style.

Trends are externally driven and constantly changing.
Style is internally driven and grows richer with age.

A company that has stood for 150 years remains standing
not because it caught every wave of trend,
but because it never needed to chase them.

The lesson for personal branding is this:
Don't ask "What's trending now?"
Ask "What is my style?"
