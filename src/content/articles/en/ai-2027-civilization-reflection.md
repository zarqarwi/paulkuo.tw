When we discuss AI 2027, our tone often resembles that of discussing an impending technological revolution. Model scale, computational races, national sovereignty, geopolitics, superintelligence.

But the real issue may not lie there.

If 2027 truly is a turning point, it tests not model capabilities, but human maturity.

## The True Meaning of the Alignment Problem

The AI industry repeatedly discusses "Alignment"—how to ensure models don't deviate from human values? How to prevent loss of control?

But this question itself contains an implicit premise: **Do we already have clarity on our own values?**

When society is polarizing, when information environments are amplified by algorithms that magnify emotions, when political trust is declining, do we truly possess a stable consensus of values?

If not, humanity's demand for AI alignment is essentially a projection. We expect technological stability while ignoring our own instability.

## The Civilizational Effects of Technical Amplifiers

AI is fundamentally an amplifier. It doesn't create human nature; it amplifies human nature.

If society favors efficiency, AI amplifies efficiency. If society favors opposition, AI amplifies opposition.

The question has never been whether technology is dangerous, but whether we're prepared to bear the consequences of being amplified.

**The indicator of civilizational maturity lies not in technological heights, but in consciousness of power and responsibility.**

## Humanity's Value Lag

Historically, technological progress has often outpaced ethical progress.

The printing press transformed religious structures, the Industrial Revolution transformed labor structures, the digital revolution transformed information structures. AI transforms decision-making structures.

But have we prepared an ethical framework for this transfer of decision-making?

If not, then AI is not a source of risk—it's merely a developer solution revealing civilizational lag.

## Civilization is Not an Efficiency Race

When nations compete for AGI, the focus is often on leading and surpassing.

But civilization's true competitiveness lies not in who creates superintelligence first, but rather:

> Who can maintain human value agency after possessing superintelligence.

If technological progress leads to trust collapse, that's not progress—that's merely acceleration.

## AI 2027 as Mirror

I prefer to view AI 2027 as a mirror. It reflects our anxiety about power, our fear of losing control, our uncertainty about our own values.

What truly needs alignment is not just models, but human understanding of our own positioning.

**If we don't reconsider "what it means to be human," then the more powerful technology becomes, the more fragile civilization becomes.**

AI 2027 is not an endpoint—it's the starting point for civilizational self-examination.

Technology can accelerate decision-making, but it cannot substitute for values.

If we want AI to align with humanity, then first, humanity must align with itself.
