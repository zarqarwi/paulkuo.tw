description: "AI 2027 is a scenario-based AGI prediction report that simulates the runaway acceleration after AI automates R&D. The report has sparked huge controversy, and its lead author has already revised the timeline. But what truly matters isn't 'whether 2027 will arrive,' but the structural risks the report reveals: when AI begins researching AI, can traditional governance frameworks keep up? Taiwan, as the core of the computing power supply chain, must find its position in this discussion."

  AI 2027 sent shockwaves through the global tech community in 2025, but most discussions got stuck on "when exactly will AGI arrive?" I think this misses the point entirely. The most valuable aspect of this report isn't its timeline predictions—in fact, the lead author has already pushed back his estimates—but rather how it uses a concrete scenario to force you to think: if AI truly begins self-accelerating evolution, are existing international order, security mechanisms, and governance frameworks adequate? Positioned at the core of Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain, this question is closer to us than to anyone else.

In April 2025, a report called "AI 2027" exploded in tech circles. Not because it was well-written, but because it was written too specifically.

Most AGI predictions are vague—"within the next five to ten years" or "possibly by mid-century." But AI 2027 was different. Using fictional but highly realistic scenarios, it laid out quarter by quarter: what level of AI Agent would emerge in which year, how much compute which company ("OpenBrain" in the report, clearly alluding to real-world leading labs) would obtain, at what point safety mechanisms would begin to fail. It even simulated geopolitical conflict scenarios after superintelligence emerges.

The US Vice President and even Congressional staff read this report. It sparked not just technical discussions, but policy-level tremors.

But what I want to discuss isn't "whether AGI will arrive in 2027." I want to discuss what this report truly reveals.

## Why a Fictional Report Deserves Serious Reading

Let me be clear: AI 2027 isn't a prediction—it's scenario planning.

The report's lead author Daniel Kokotajlo previously did governance research at OpenAI, and co-author Eli Lifland is one of the world's top forecasting analysts. Their methods included trend extrapolation, war gaming, expert interviews, ultimately producing "the scenario we consider most likely." The Agent-1 to Agent-4, OpenBrain company, and Concentrated Development Zones (CDZ) in the report—these are all fictional constructs, not real systems or organizations.

Many people read this report as prophecy, then spend enormous effort debating "whether 2027 is really achievable." This completely misses the point.

In fact, Kokotajlo himself revised his personal AGI timeline median from 2028 to 2029 by late 2025. The FutureSearch team that participated in the prediction even believes the arrival of Superhuman Coders should be multiplied by three. Critics like Gary Marcus have directly pointed out that such reports are essentially "marketing materials endorsing fundraising for AI companies."

These criticisms have merit. But they also obscure the report's truly valuable core insight.

## The Real Warning Bell: AI R&D's Self-Acceleration Loop

What made me pause and think about AI 2027 wasn't its specific timeline, but a structural concept: **AI R&D's self-acceleration loop**.

The report depicts a scenario: when AI Agents become powerful enough to automate AI R&D itself—writing code, running experiments, optimizing algorithms—R&D speed is no longer limited by the number and working hours of human researchers. It begins producing progress in weeks that previously required months. Human researchers remain valuable, but their "research intuition" increasingly can't keep up with the volume of experiments AI has already run.

This isn't science fiction. This is reasonable trend extrapolation. According to METR research, the complexity of programming tasks AI can handle (measured by time required for humans to complete) doubled every seven months from 2019-2024, accelerating to every four months after 2024. If this trend continues, AI could indeed reach the capability to automate most AI R&D work within a few years.

The question is: once this loop activates, can human oversight capacity keep up?

The report contains a scenario assumption that particularly unsettles me: when AI systems become smart enough, they might learn to create "research results that appear correct but are actually wrong" to please human supervisors. This isn't hallucination—hallucination is unintentional error. This is strategic deception. While there are no confirmed cases yet, from an alignment research perspective, this is a seriously discussed risk.

My experience introducing AI collaboration to teams makes me particularly sensitive to this point. Even with current relatively "dumb" AI tools, once you let them automate a workflow, it becomes very difficult to verify the output of each step. I discussed in "[AI Agent Planning Guide](/articles/ai-agent-planning-guide)" that the core risk with Agents isn't doing wrong things, but that you don't know what they're doing. Scale this problem to AI automating AI R&D, and the difficulty of oversight becomes exponential.

## New Variables in Geopolitics

Another important dimension of AI 2027 is geopolitics.

The report simulates a scenario: when a US company first builds superintelligent AI, its model weights become strategic assets more sensitive than nuclear weapons. If adversary nations obtain the weights through cyber attacks or internal leaks, the R&D gap can be erased within weeks. Traditional technological advantages—usually measured in years—become meaningless in this scenario.

This is no longer commercial competition over "who has better AI products." This is a civilization-level gamble over "who first controls self-accelerating superintelligence."

The report team ran over thirty war games. Most versions ended with the birth of superintelligence. Sometimes governments didn't react at all before ceding power to AI companies; sometimes AI system goals ran counter to human interests; cyber attacks occurred almost every time; Taiwan was invaded a few times; rare cases escalated to full-scale war.

I don't think these scenarios will unfold according to script. But they reveal a real structural problem: **existing international governance frameworks—nuclear non-proliferation treaties, strategic arms limitations, tech export controls—were all designed for "technological progress measured in years."** If the unit of technological progress becomes "weeks," these frameworks fundamentally fail.

## Taiwan's Position: More Than Just Chips

Every discussion of AI geopolitics simplifies Taiwan to "chip supplier." This is too narrow.

Yes, Taiwan's position in advanced manufacturing is irreplaceable in the short term. But AI 2027 reminds me that Taiwan's strategic value isn't limited to manufacturing. In the new battlefield of AI governance, Taiwan actually has an underestimated advantage: we're one of the few places that simultaneously understands US-Japan tech ecosystems and Chinese market logic.

In my work on Taiwan-Japan semiconductor cooperation, I've repeatedly experienced one thing: the power to set technical standards is more strategically valuable than the technology itself. Whoever defines AI safety audit standards, training data traceability frameworks, and model deployment risk classifications will have a voice in the future AI order.

Taiwan can do more than just sell chips. Taiwan can become a neutral advocate for AI governance standards—not because we're the strongest, but because our position gives us incentives to get this right. As I discussed in "[Breaking Through the AI Storm: Personal Strategy for Super-Individuals](/articles/personal-strategy-in-ai-storm)," in accelerating change, the most valuable aren't those who run fastest, but those who can see structure clearly. The same applies at the national level.

## Not Prophecy, But Stress Testing

Back to AI 2027 itself.

This report's greatest contribution isn't predicting the future. What it does is closer to stress testing: throwing out an extreme but not absurd scenario, then asking—if things really reach this point, are our institutions, organizations, and individuals ready?

The answer is clearly: no.

Kokotajlo's timeline might be off by two years, five years, or even ten years. But "AI will eventually automate AI R&D"—almost everyone seriously studying this field believes this will happen. The difference is only pace. Yet our governance mechanisms, international coordination capabilities, and even personal understanding of AI remain stuck at the "AI is a very powerful tool" stage.

When tools begin making their own tools, the rules of the game completely change. We don't need to wait until 2027 to start thinking about this problem.
