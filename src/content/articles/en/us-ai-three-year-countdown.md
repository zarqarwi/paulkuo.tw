  Sam Altman's three-year countdown has reached year two, and I'm reassessing the progress of this timeline. L3 Agent capabilities have arrived but reliability hasn't; AGI narrative has shifted from magical moments to gradual awakening; Stargate has transformed from presentation slides to hundreds of billions in contracts; Middle East resource-for-technology exchanges are reshaping geopolitical order. As someone who uses AI for daily work, what I want to understand isn't whether Altman is a prophet, but where we actually are—and Taiwan's position on this chessboard.

Last May, Sam Altman delivered a three-year countdown timeline at Sequoia Capital's AI Summit: 2025 as the year of assistants, 2026 entering research, 2027 stepping into the physical world.

It sounded like fundraising rhetoric at the time. But nine months later, I've found that how I use Claude and ChatGPT for daily work has become completely different from last year. It's not simply "more useful"—entire workflows have been reorganized.

This made me revisit that timeline. Not to verify whether Altman is a prophet, but to figure out: where exactly are we?

## Five-Level Model: From Theoretical Framework to Living Coordinates

OpenAI's original five-level AI evolution model is essentially a capability spectrum: L1 chatbots, L2 reasoning, L3 agents, L4 innovation, L5 organizations. Last year, everyone debated "are we at L2 or L3?" Now the answer is gradually becoming clear.

ChatGPT's Agent Mode is already live—you can have it go through hundreds of emails, help with research, automatically organize data. The GPT-5 series has iterated from launch to 5.1, 5.2, and even 5.2-Codex specifically for coding tasks. OpenAI retired six models at once in February 2026, including GPT-4o and o4-mini, essentially declaring: we're not looking back.

But does this mean "L3 has arrived"? My observation is: capabilities have arrived, reliability hasn't. When you have an AI agent help you with a task, it completes it 80% of the time, but the remaining 20% happens to be exactly where you cannot afford errors. This isn't a minor issue—this is the real chasm between L3 and L4.

## Timeline Revision: From "Three Years to AGI" to "Gradual Awakening"

What's most noteworthy isn't whether OpenAI has followed the schedule, but how they've quietly modified their narrative approach.

Altman's latest statement: "AGI isn't some magical moment, it's more like a process, and you're already on the path." OpenAI's CTO Jakub Pachocki provided more specific milestones—creating "research intern" level AI by September 2026, and AI researchers capable of independently completing research projects by 2028.

Notice this shift: from "reaching AGI within three years" to "creating AI interns within two years." The goal dropped a level, but the timeline became more credible. This isn't weakness, it's engineer-like pragmatism—first prove AI can be an intern, then discuss whether it can be a professor.

## Infrastructure Arms Race

The original article mentioned Altman's five recommendations at the Senate hearing. Nine months later, each has transformed into real money and action:

The "Stargate" project has evolved from presentations to contracts, with OpenAI's committed infrastructure investment exceeding 30 gigawatts of computing power. Cross-industry supply chain contracts with AMD, Broadcom, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Oracle are worth hundreds of billions. Altman says he wants to compress per-gigawatt computing costs below $20 billion—this sounds like energy policy rather than a tech project, which is exactly the point.

When computing power becomes infrastructure like electricity, AI is no longer Silicon Valley's toy, but global public goods. The question is: who controls this "AI grid"?

## Middle East Chess Game: New Geopolitical Order of Resources-for-Technology

The Middle East trips mentioned in the original article—Altman accompanying Trump to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE—looked like diplomatic shows at the time, but in retrospect were opening moves in strategic positioning. Saudi Arabia's $600 billion investment commitment and Qatar's $243.5 billion order have exceeded the scope of "tech cooperation."

Essentially, this is a trade: America provides technology and chips, the Middle East provides money and energy. AI training is energy-intensive, and the Middle East has the world's cheapest energy. If this combination works, it changes not just AI industry supply chains, but global power centers.

Where does Taiwan sit on this chessboard? We hold the lifeline of advanced processes, but we're not protagonists in either AI applications or energy. In "[Taiwan Semiconductor's Tenfold Leap](/articles/taiwan-semiconductor-tenfold-leap)," I discussed how process advantages are both moats and ceilings—if we only defend foundry services, when AI value chains tilt toward applications and energy, moats become isolated islands. This gap is what we should really worry about.

## Sober Observations from the Penultimate Year

Back to that three-year timeline. If 2025 was the "year of assistants," this prediction has largely materialized—AI has indeed upgraded from "Q&A tools" to "task executors." But what about 2026's "year of research"?

Currently, what AI can do is accelerate research processes, organize literature, run data analysis. What it cannot do is propose original hypotheses, design experiments, or course-correct through failures. In other words, AI is becoming a very good research assistant, but there's still a fundamental gap before it becomes a "researcher."

My personal judgment: the 2027 "physical world" goal will likely be delayed. Not because technology isn't sufficient, but because trust isn't sufficient. When AI begins operating in the physical world—factories, healthcare, transportation—error tolerance approaches zero, and current reliability can't support that standard.

Two years into the three-year countdown, sobriety matters more than optimism. Technology is accelerating, but building trust has no shortcuts.
