  Sam Altman's three-year countdown has reached its second year, and I'm re-examining the progress of this timeline's fulfillment. L3 Agent capabilities have arrived but reliability hasn't; AGI narrative has shifted from magical moments to gradual awakening; Stargate has transformed from presentation to hundred-billion-dollar contracts; Middle Eastern resource-for-technology exchanges are reshaping geopolitical order. As someone who uses AI daily for work, what I want to understand isn't whether Altman is a prophet, but where exactly we stand—and Taiwan's position on this chessboard.

Last May, at Sequoia Capital's AI Summit, Sam Altman dropped a three-year countdown timeline: 2025 as the year of assistants, 2026 entering research, 2027 stepping into the physical world.

At the time, it sounded like fundraising presentation rhetoric. But nine months later, I've discovered that how I use Claude and ChatGPT for daily work has completely changed from last year. It's not simply "more useful"—entire workflows have been reorganized.

This made me revisit that timeline. Not to verify whether Altman is a prophet, but to figure out: where exactly are we?

## Five-Level Model: From Theoretical Framework to Living Coordinates

OpenAI's original five-level AI evolution model is essentially a capability spectrum: L1 chat, L2 reasoning, L3 agents, L4 innovation, L5 organizations. Last year everyone debated "are we at L2 or L3," and now the answer is gradually becoming clear.

ChatGPT's Agent Mode is already live—you can have it sort through hundreds of emails, help with research, automatically organize data. The GPT-5 series has iterated from launch to 5.1, 5.2, and even 5.2-Codex specifically for coding tasks. OpenAI's direct retirement of GPT-4o and o4-mini in February 2026 essentially declared: we're not looking back.

But does this mean "L3 has arrived"? My observation is: capability has arrived, reliability hasn't. When you let an AI agent help you with something, it can complete it 80% of the time, but that remaining 20% happens to be exactly where you cannot afford mistakes. This isn't a minor issue—this is the real chasm between L3 and L4.

## Timeline Revision: From "Three Years to AGI" to "Gradual Awakening"

What's most noteworthy isn't whether OpenAI followed their schedule, but how they quietly modified their narrative approach.

Altman's latest statement: "AGI isn't some magical moment, it's more like a process, and you're already on the path." OpenAI's CTO Jakub Pachocki provided more concrete milestones—creating "research intern" level AI by September 2026, and AI researchers capable of independently completing research projects by March 2028.

Notice this shift: from "reaching AGI within three years" to "creating AI interns within two years." The goal dropped a level, but the timeline became more credible. This isn't weakness, it's engineering pragmatism—first prove AI can be an intern, then discuss whether it can be a professor.

## Infrastructure Arms Race

The original article mentioned Altman's five recommendations at the Senate hearing, and nine months later, each has become real money action:

The "Stargate" project has transformed from presentation to contract, with OpenAI's promised infrastructure investment exceeding 30 gigawatts of computing power, and cross-industry supply chain contracts with AMD, Broadcom, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle worth hundreds of billions. Altman's goal of compressing computing cost per gigawatt below $20 billion sounds like energy policy rather than a tech project—which is exactly the point.

When computing power becomes basic infrastructure like electricity, AI is no longer Silicon Valley's toy, but global public goods. The question is: who controls this "AI grid"?

## Middle Eastern Chess Game: New Geopolitical Order of Resources for Technology

The Middle Eastern itinerary mentioned in the original article—Altman accompanying Trump's visits to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE—looked like diplomatic theater at the time, but in hindsight was the opening move of strategic positioning. Saudi Arabia's commitment of $600 billion investment and Qatar's $243.5 billion contract have exceeded the scope of "technological cooperation."

Essentially, this is a deal: America provides technology and chips, the Middle East provides money and energy. AI training is power-hungry, and the Middle East has the world's cheapest energy. If this combination succeeds, it changes not just AI industry supply chains, but the center of global power.

Where does Taiwan stand on this chessboard? We hold the lifeline of advanced processes, but we're not main players in AI applications or energy. In "[Taiwan Semiconductor's Tenfold Leap](/articles/taiwan-semiconductor-tenfold-leap)," I discussed how process advantages are both moats and ceilings—if we only guard foundry services, when AI value chains tilt toward applications and energy, moats become islands. This gap is what we should truly worry about.

## Sober Observations in the Penultimate Year

Back to that three-year timeline. If 2025 was the "year of assistants," this prediction has basically materialized—AI has indeed upgraded from "Q&A tool" to "task executor." But what about 2026 as the "year of research"?

Currently, AI can accelerate research processes, organize literature, and run data analysis. What it cannot do is propose original hypotheses, design experiments, or adjust direction through failure. In other words, AI is becoming a very good research assistant, but there's still a fundamental gap from being a "researcher."

My personal judgment: the 2027 "physical world" goal will likely be delayed. Not because the technology isn't sufficient, but because trust isn't sufficient. When AI begins operating in the physical world—factories, healthcare, transportation—the margin for error approaches zero, and current reliability cannot support this standard.

Two years into the three-year countdown, sobriety matters more than optimism. Technology is accelerating, but building trust has no shortcuts.
