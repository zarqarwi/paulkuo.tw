Last May, Sam Altman presented a three-year countdown timeline at Sequoia Capital's AI Summit: 2025 as the year of assistants, 2026 entering scientific research, and 2027 stepping into the physical world.

At the time, it sounded like fundraising pitch rhetoric. But nine months later, I find that how I use Claude and ChatGPT for work daily has become completely different from last year. It's not simply "more useful"—the entire workflow has been reorganized.

This led me to revisit that timeline. Not to verify whether Altman is a prophet, but to understand: where exactly are we now?

## The Five-Level Model: From Theoretical Framework to Living Coordinates

OpenAI's original five-level AI evolution model is essentially a capability spectrum: L1 chatbots, L2 reasoning, L3 agents, L4 innovation, L5 organizations. Last year, everyone debated whether "we're at L2 or L3." Now the answer is becoming clearer.

ChatGPT's Agent Mode is already live—you can have it go through hundreds of emails, help with research, and automatically organize data. The GPT-5 series has iterated from launch to now with 5.1, 5.2, and even 5.2-Codex specifically for coding tasks. OpenAI directly retired GPT-4o and o4-mini in February 2026, effectively declaring: we're not looking back.

But does this mean "L3 has arrived"? My observation is: the capability is there, but reliability isn't yet. When you ask an AI agent to do something, it succeeds 80% of the time, but that remaining 20% happens to be exactly where you can't afford errors. This isn't a minor issue—this is the real chasm between L3 and L4.

## Timeline Adjustments: From "Three Years to AGI" to "Gradual Awakening"

What's most noteworthy isn't whether OpenAI stuck to their schedule, but how they quietly modified their narrative.

Altman's latest position is: "AGI isn't some magical moment, it's more like a process, and you're already on the path." OpenAI's CTO Jakub Pachocki provided more concrete milestones—creating "research intern" level AI by September 2026, and AI researchers capable of independently completing scientific projects by March 2028.

Notice this shift: from "reaching AGI within three years" to "creating AI interns within two years." The goal dropped a level, but the timeline became more credible. This isn't weakness, it's engineer-style pragmatism—first prove AI can be an intern, then discuss whether it can be a professor.

## The Infrastructure Arms Race

The original article mentioned Altman's five recommendations at the Senate hearing. Nine months later, each has transformed from proposal to actual investment:

The "Stargate" project has evolved from presentation to contracts, with OpenAI's promised infrastructure investment exceeding 30 gigawatts of computing capacity. Cross-industry supply chain contracts with AMD, Broadcom, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Oracle are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Altman's goal to reduce computing costs to under $20 billion per gigawatt sounds like energy policy rather than a tech project—which is precisely the point.

When computing power becomes infrastructure like electricity, AI is no longer Silicon Valley's toy, but global public utility. The question is: who controls this "AI grid"?

## Middle Eastern Chess Game: A New Geopolitical Order of Resources for Technology

The Middle Eastern visits mentioned in the original article—Altman accompanying Trump to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE—seemed like diplomatic theater at the time, but now appear as opening moves in strategic positioning. Saudi Arabia's $600 billion commitment and Qatar's $243.5 billion contracts have transcended the scope of "tech cooperation."

Essentially, this is a trade: America provides technology and chips, the Middle East provides money and energy. AI training is energy-intensive, and the Middle East has the world's cheapest energy. If this combination succeeds, it changes not just AI industry supply chains, but global power centers.

Taiwan's position on this chessboard? We hold the lifeline of advanced manufacturing processes, but we're not leading players in AI applications or energy. This gap is what we should really be concerned about.

## Clear-Eyed Observations in the Penultimate Year

Back to that three-year timeline. If 2025 was the "year of assistants," this prediction has largely materialized—AI has indeed upgraded from "Q&A tools" to "task executors." But what about 2026's "year of scientific research"?

Currently, AI can accelerate research processes, organize literature, and run data analysis. What it can't do is propose original hypotheses, design experiments, or adjust direction based on failures. In other words, AI is becoming an excellent research assistant, but there's still a fundamental gap to becoming a "researcher."

My personal assessment: the 2027 "physical world" goal will likely be delayed. Not because the technology isn't ready, but because trust isn't ready. When AI begins operating in the physical world—factories, healthcare, transportation—error tolerance approaches zero, and current reliability can't meet this standard.

Two years into the three-year countdown, clarity matters more than optimism. Technology is accelerating, but building trust has no shortcuts.
