title: "World Outlook 2030: Finding Position Between Technological Acceleration and Physical Limits"
subtitle: "True foresight isn't predicting the future, but understanding which variables you can influence"
description: "The world of 2030 won't be determined by any single technology, but constrained by the interactions between physical limits, geopolitical games, and ethical boundaries. AGI, quantum computing, climate resilience—every axis has a ceiling. Facing an uncertain future, rather than pursuing precise predictions, it's better to build strategic resilience that can survive multiple scenarios."
abstract: |
  I stand simultaneously at three fields being reshaped by technology—AI, semiconductor supply chains, and circular economy. This position gives me a view of 2030 that's different from most: I can see both technological acceleration and touch physical limits daily. AGI won't fully arrive by 2030, but deep AI specialization will rewrite the cost structures of all industries. Quantum computing remains experimental, but its threat to cryptography is already changing national strategies. Climate resilience isn't a slogan—it's the water and electricity cost reality I face daily in metal recycling. This isn't a prediction report, but an attempt by someone at the intersection of multiple fields to clarify which variables are worth betting on and which ceilings cannot be ignored.

My work places me simultaneously in three fields being reshaped by technology: AI, semiconductor supply chains, and circular economy.

This position has one advantage: I can see both technological acceleration and touch physical limits daily. When you're running debate engines with four AI models while handling water and electricity bills for metal recycling production lines, your feelings about "technology will change everything" become rather complex.

So my view of 2030 doesn't start from technological potential, but from constraints. Behind every beautiful-looking technology curve lies a physical, economic, or ethical ceiling. Only by seeing the ceiling clearly can you know where the real opportunities lie.

## AGI: Deepening Will Come, General Won't Yet

AGI is the hottest narrative of recent years. But if you're actually using AI to get things done—not playing, but making daily decisions with it—you know we're still far from artificial general intelligence.

I analyzed in "[US AI Three-Year Countdown](/articles/us-ai-three-year-countdown)" that current AI bottlenecks aren't just algorithmic, but also include physical limits of computational resources (power consumption, heat dissipation) and ceilings on high-quality training data. AI in 2030 is more likely to show "deepening in specialized domains"—medical diagnosis, materials science, manufacturing optimization—rather than comprehensive AGI breakthroughs.

But the impact of "deepening" itself will be significant enough. When AI reaches levels surpassing human experts in specific domains—I discussed in "[AI More Socially Intelligent Than Humans](/articles/ai-social-intelligence-psychologist)" how this is already happening in social intelligence—industry cost structures and talent requirements will be completely rewritten. Human-AI collaboration isn't an option; it's inevitable.

## Quantum Computing: Threats Arrive Before Applications

Quantum computing has enormous potential in cryptography and materials science, and is a key geopolitical variable. But it faces quantum coherence instability and extremely high error correction costs. By 2030, hybrid systems will still dominate, with universal quantum computers remaining in experimental stages.

Interestingly, quantum computing's threats are moving faster than its applications. Nations are already preparing for how "quantum supremacy" might break existing encryption systems, directly affecting semiconductor industry strategic positioning. I discussed in "[Taiwan Semiconductor's Tenfold Leap](/articles/taiwan-semiconductor-tenfold-leap)" that Taiwan's next round of competition isn't just in manufacturing processes, but in system integration capabilities. Quantum computing's timeline will accelerate this transformation.

## Climate Resilience: Not a Slogan, But Cost Structure

Doing metal recycling at SDTI, climate resilience isn't an abstract concept for me—it's every month's utility bills.

Renewable energy development is constrained by materials science bottlenecks and long cycles of infrastructure updates. But the more fundamental issue is: climate risks aren't single events, but triggers for compound crises—when extreme climate simultaneously impacts supply chains, food systems, and population flows, no single-point solution is adequate.

This is why I keep saying "circular economy isn't idealism." When water, electricity, and chemical costs all rise, resource reallocation efficiency directly determines your competitiveness. This is especially true for the semiconductor industry—if recycling efficiency improves by 5%, the impact on profit structure far exceeds cutting 1% of personnel costs.

## Silent Reorganization of Social Structure

Technological change attracts all the attention, but social structural changes are often more profound.

Aging populations, gig economy, and digital transformation are happening simultaneously. Education systems still teach skills from twenty years ago, while labor markets already demand completely different capabilities. I discussed in "[Canary in the Coal Mine: AI Employment](/articles/canary-in-coal-mine-ai-employment)" that what's being eliminated isn't specific positions, but entire division-of-labor logic. UBI (Universal Basic Income) has transformed from academic concept to policy experiment, not because of idealism, but because the old social contract can't hold.

## Don't Predict, Build Resilience

My most honest attitude toward 2030 is: I don't know. No one knows.

Every seemingly certain trend has variables behind it that could be overturned by black swans. AGI might arrive five years early due to an algorithmic breakthrough, or stagnate for ten years due to soaring energy costs.

So my chosen strategy isn't precise prediction, but building resilience that can survive multiple scenarios. Deepening human-AI collaboration capabilities in the AI field. Strengthening system integration rather than just defending manufacturing processes in semiconductors. Making resource reallocation a core competitive advantage rather than just an ESG label in circular economy.

True foresight isn't predicting the future. It's understanding which variables you can influence, then concentrating resources there.
