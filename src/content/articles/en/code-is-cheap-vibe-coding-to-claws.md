  In ten years, Andrej Karpathy has created four era-defining terms, from Hallucination to Vibe Coding to Claws, each capturing pivotal moments in human-machine relationships. Simon Willison's "Code is cheap" inverts Linus Torvalds' classic declaration from twenty-five years ago. This isn't linear efficiency improvement—it's a phase transition in cost structure. When the price of experimentation approaches zero, things that were "not worth doing" suddenly become worth doing.

## Nine Months, One Word, Collective Awakening

On February 2, 2025, Andrej Karpathy casually dropped a term on X: Vibe Coding.

The state he described was simple—complete immersion in the vibe, following your intuition, even forgetting you're writing code. No rigorous definition, no academic framework, just two English words.

Nine months later, Collins Dictionary selected it as Word of the Year.

For context: "cloud computing," introduced in 2006, took several years to enter mainstream vocabulary. The transmission speed of Vibe Coding is itself a signal—it's not describing new technology, but naming a collective experience that was already happening. When a word can spread this rapidly, it means it has touched something real that was waiting to be spoken.

## Ten Years of Archaeology from the Master of Names

Karpathy isn't just an AI researcher; he's the most precise terminology forger of our era. Ten years, four words, each hitting inflection points in human-machine relationships.

In 2015, Karpathy used the word “hallucination” in his essay *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks* to describe how language models generate URLs and content that look perfectly plausible yet are entirely fabricated—effectively coining an intuitive, precise name for the phenomenon of “AI making things up.”

2017 brought Software 2.0. Traditional software: humans write rules for machines to execute. Software 2.0: humans feed data for machines to learn their own rules. This wasn't just a technical route switch, but a fundamental redefinition of "who writes the code."

2025's Vibe Coding shifted focus from "how AI learns" to "how humans use it." Programmers no longer scrutinize every line of code, but dialogue with AI, iterate, and move forward when it feels right. Rigor yields to intuition, control yields to trust.

Then came 2026's Claws—a new layer above AI agents: orchestration, scheduling, context management, tool calling, persistence. Karpathy used an intuitive metaphor: underlying large models are wheat harvested from fields, agents are ground flour, and Claws is baked bread, ready to use.

Mac Mini sales surged due to demand for running local AI agents, "selling like hot pancakes at a North American breakfast joint." This isn't about server farms anymore—this is happening on desks.

## Talk is cheap → Code is cheap

On February 23, 2026, Django co-founder Simon Willison launched Agentic Engineering Patterns, opening with a bombshell:

"Writing code is cheap now."

If you've been in software, you know what this overturns. In 2000, Linus Torvalds said those words carved into countless engineers' minds: "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." This defined an entire generation's engineering culture—code was scarce, the ultimate carrier of value, and you only counted if you could write it.

Twenty-five years later, Willison flipped it. Code is cheap. Show me the talk. Code is cheap—show me how you describe requirements, how you make decisions.

This isn't rhetorical play. Google Principal Engineer Yana Dogan said her team's distributed agent orchestrator that took all of 2025 to build was completed in just one hour using Claude Code in 2026. Vercel CTO Malte Ubl, powered by Opus 4.5, completed two major open-source projects during vacation, started writing a book, and fixed numerous bugs—he said it would be "absolutely impossible without AI."

A year's work compressed into an hour. This isn't linear efficiency improvement—this is a phase transition in cost structure.

## Things "Not Worth Doing" Suddenly Become Worth Doing

Most people hearing "AI makes programming cheaper" first think "great, faster delivery." This understanding isn't wrong, but it's shallow.

The real revolution isn't making existing work faster, but making things "not worth doing" worth doing.

Every development team has an invisible list—features deemed "poor ROI" and never prioritized, improvements that "would be nice but cost too much to develop," requests that "only serve a few users so we won't build them." When programming's marginal cost approaches zero, this entire list suddenly comes alive.

Willison's advice is practical: whenever your instinct says "not worth the time," try AI first. Worst case: waste a few cents on tokens. Best case: discover an opportunity that couldn't have existed before.

But he honestly adds: "good code" remains expensive. Functional correctness, edge case handling, maintainability, test coverage, documentation quality—these quality standards haven't lowered because of AI. What's cheap is the first draft, not the finished product.

## How Should Taiwan's Knowledge Workers View This

The "code is cheap" logic doesn't only apply to software development. Replace "code" with any knowledge work output—drafts, reports, analyses, design mockups—the same cost structure change is occurring.

Writing: AI can quickly generate drafts, but judging which ideas deserve development, which paragraphs to delete, still requires humans. Design: AI can produce a hundred options, but discerning which truly solves user problems still requires humans. Data analysis: AI can run all models, but deciding the right questions to ask and questioning unreasonable conclusions still requires humans.

Former Uber engineer Gergely Orosz distills core AI-era capabilities into three: Judgment—distinguishing good from bad AI output; Strategic thinking—knowing what to do, not how to do it; Domain expertise—validating AI-generated content accuracy.

For Taiwan, we have the world's densest concentration of tech talent, but also many roles dependent on "execution ability" rather than "judgment." When execution costs are compressed to near-zero by AI, only judgment can create differentiated value. This isn't a threat narrative, but it is a structural recalibration.

## Grandma Doesn't Need to Know Apps Exist

When someone questioned Karpathy's Claws concept, his response was one sentence:

"Grandma shouldn't have to understand technical issues like how applications are deployed, because her AI assistant should know about them."

This sentence is an endgame prophecy. The future isn't teaching everyone to code, but making AI the intermediary between humans and systems. Users only need to express intent—"help me book tomorrow's train ticket to Tainan"—and AI automatically decides whether to call existing apps or instantly generate a customized solution. The concept of "applications" might disappear from user cognition.

From Vibe Coding to Claws, Karpathy uses two words to trace a trajectory: first humans and AI write code together, then AI manages entire systems itself while humans only specify what they want.

The question is no longer "can you code?"

The question is "do you know what problems should be solved?"

And that question was never cheap.
