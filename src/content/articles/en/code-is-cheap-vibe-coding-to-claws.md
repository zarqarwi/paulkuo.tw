  In a decade, Andrej Karpathy created four era-defining terms, from Hallucination to Vibe Coding to Claws, each hitting a turning point in human-machine relations. Simon Willison's "Code is cheap" overturned Linus Torvalds' classic declaration from twenty-five years ago. This isn't linear efficiency improvement, but a phase transition in cost structure—when the price of experimentation approaches zero, everything that was "not worth doing" suddenly becomes worthwhile.

## Nine Months, One Word, One Collective Awakening

On February 2, 2025, Andrej Karpathy casually dropped a term on X: Vibe Coding.

The state he described was simple—completely immersed in the atmosphere, following the flow, even forgetting you're writing code. No rigorous definition, no academic framework, just two English words.

Nine months later, Collins Dictionary selected it as Word of the Year.

For contrast: "Cloud Computing" took several years from its 2006 introduction to enter common vocabulary. The transmission speed of Vibe Coding is itself a signal—it's not describing a new technology, but naming a collective experience that had already occurred. When a word can spread at this velocity, it means it's touched upon some truth waiting to be spoken.

## A Decade of Archaeology by the Naming Master

Karpathy isn't just an AI researcher; he's the most precise terminology forger of this era. In ten years, four words, each stepping on a turning point in human-machine relations.

In 2015, Karpathy used "hallucination" in "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks" to describe language models generating URLs and content that looked reasonable but were fabricated from thin air, essentially coining an intuitive and apt term for this "AI making stuff up" behavior.

2017 brought Software 2.0. Traditional software is humans writing rules for machines to execute; Software 2.0 is humans feeding data for machines to learn rules themselves. This wasn't just a switch in technical approaches, but a fundamental redefinition of "who writes programs."

2025's Vibe Coding shifted focus from "how AI learns" to "how humans use it." Programmers no longer scrutinize every line of code, but dialogue with AI, iterate, and move forward when it feels right. Rigor gives way to intuition, control gives way to trust.

Then came 2026's Claws. This term refers to a new layer above AI agents: orchestration, scheduling, context management, tool invocation, persistence. Karpathy used a very intuitive metaphor—the underlying large models are wheat harvested from the field, agents are milled flour, and Claws are baked bread, ready to use.

Mac Mini sales surged due to demand for running local AI agents, selling "like hotcakes at North American breakfast diners." This isn't about server rooms anymore; this is about what's on your desk.

## Talk is cheap → Code is cheap

On February 23, 2026, Django framework co-founder Simon Willison released the new project Agentic Engineering Patterns, opening with a bombshell:

"Writing code is cheap now."

If you've been in the software world, you know what this statement is overturning. In 2000, Linus Torvalds said that phrase etched into countless engineers' minds: "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." Empty talk is cheap, show me the code. This phrase defined an entire generation's engineering culture—code was the scarce resource, the ultimate carrier of value, you only counted if you could write it.

Twenty-five years later, Willison flipped it around. Code is cheap. Show me the talk. Code has become cheap, let me see how you describe requirements, how you make decisions.

This isn't rhetorical play. Google Principal Engineer Yana Dogan said her team's distributed agent orchestrator that took a whole year to build in 2025 was completed in just one hour using Claude Code in 2026. Vercel CTO Malte Ubl, using Opus 4.5, completed two major open-source projects during vacation, started writing a book, and fixed a bunch of bugs—he said "absolutely impossible without AI."

A year's work compressed into one hour. This isn't linear efficiency improvement; this is a phase transition in cost structure.

## Things "Not Worth Doing" Suddenly Became Worth Doing

Most people hearing "AI makes programming cheaper" first think "great, we can deliver faster." This understanding is correct, but too shallow.

The real revolution isn't making existing work faster, but making things "originally not worth doing" worth doing.

Every development team has an invisible list—features deemed "not cost-effective in terms of input-output ratio" that never make it to priority, improvements that "would be nice but too expensive to develop," requirements that "serve too few users so we don't do them." When the marginal cost of programming approaches zero, this entire list suddenly comes alive.

Willison's advice is practical: whenever your instinct says "not worth the time," try AI first. The worst outcome is wasting a few cents on tokens; the best outcome is discovering an opportunity that couldn't have existed before.

But he also honestly added: "good code" remains expensive. Functional correctness, edge case handling, maintainability, test coverage, documentation quality—these quality standards haven't lowered because of AI. What's cheap is the first draft, not the finished product.

## How Should Taiwan's Knowledge Workers View This

The logic of "code becoming cheap" doesn't only apply to software development. Replace "code" with any knowledge work output—drafts, reports, analysis, design mockups—the same cost structure change is happening.

Writing: AI can quickly generate drafts, but judging which viewpoints are worth developing, which paragraphs should be deleted, still requires humans. Design: AI can produce a hundred solutions, but discerning which solution truly solves user problems still requires humans. Data analysis: AI can run all models, but deciding on the right questions to ask, questioning unreasonable conclusions, still requires humans.

Former Uber engineer Gergely Orosz summarized the core capabilities of the AI era into three: judgment—distinguishing good from bad AI output; strategic thinking—knowing what to do, not how to do it; domain expertise—verifying the accuracy of AI-generated content.

For Taiwan, we have the world's densest concentration of tech talent, but also many job positions that rely on "execution ability" rather than "judgment." When execution costs are compressed to near zero by AI, only judgment can create differentiated value. This isn't a threat narrative, but it is indeed a structural recalibration.

## Grandma Doesn't Need to Know Apps Exist

When someone questioned Karpathy's Claws concept, his response was just one sentence:

"Grandma shouldn't have to understand technical issues like how apps are deployed, because her AI assistant should know these things."

This statement is an endgame prophecy. The future isn't about teaching everyone to code, but making AI the intermediary between people and systems. Users only need to express intent—"help me book a ticket to Tainan tomorrow"—and AI automatically decides whether to invoke existing apps or generate a customized solution on the fly. The concept of "applications" might disappear from users' cognition.

From Vibe Coding to Claws, Karpathy used two words to trace a trajectory: first humans and AI write code together, then AI manages the entire system itself, with humans only responsible for saying what they want.

The question is no longer "can you write code." The question is "do you know what problems should be solved."

And that question was never cheap.
