title: "Revering the Unknown Surge: Market Lessons Ten Years After the Financial Crisis"
subtitle: "We know too much, understand too little—the market taught me not how to predict, but how to be humble"
description: "In 2017, nearly ten years after the financial crisis, Taiwan's stock market reached a five-year high, the U.S. Dow broke through 23,000 points, and global markets were optimistic. But what was really driving the markets—genuine economic recovery or a flood of liquidity created by central banks printing money frantically? This question has no standard answer, and 'having no standard answer' is itself the most important lesson. Markets are not physical systems; they don't follow Newton's laws. Facing capital surges and complex economic systems, the only thing we can maintain is humility toward the unknown."
abstract: |
  In the ten years from the 2008 financial crisis to the 2017 market highs, Paul personally experienced the cognitive dissonance of "being bearish while markets kept rising." Those who shorted were carried out by the market, while those who held on didn't necessarily understand why they made money. This article isn't investment advice, but reflections from someone who learned humility in the markets—through his experience serving clients at SDTI, Paul discovered that companies and investors make strikingly similar mistakes: over-trusting their own judgment and underestimating system complexity. True wisdom isn't knowing the answers, but admitting you don't know.

In October 2017, Taiwan's weighted stock index reached 10,700 points—a five-year high.

If you've been bearish on markets since the 2008 financial crisis—trust me, many smart people were—by 2017, the market had been slapping you in the face for nearly ten years. Every time you thought "this rally has peaked," the market responded with a new red candlestick telling you: your judgment doesn't matter to it.

This wasn't a phenomenon unique to Taiwan. Across the Pacific, the U.S. Dow Jones broke through 23,000 points during the same period—a historic high. Korea's KOSPI also hovered around multi-year highs. The global market narrative was synchronized: up.

Those who shorted had long since been carried out, no one knows how many times.

But what exactly was fueling this rally?

On the surface, it was prospects of economic recovery. After 2008, governments launched unprecedented fiscal stimulus and monetary easing policies. Economic data improved year by year, employment rates recovered, corporate profits grew—every indicator said "the worst is over."

But if you peel back the surface layer, you see another story: global central banks printing money frantically.

U.S. quantitative easing (QE), the European Central Bank's negative interest rate policies, Japan's three arrows of Abenomics—these policies created trillions in liquidity. Excess capital desperately needed to find harbors. Stock markets, real estate, bonds, even cryptocurrencies—every asset class was pushed higher by surplus liquidity.

So the question becomes: were markets rising because the economy really improved, or because there was too much money?

Honestly, no one knows. Or more precisely: everyone has an explanation, but no one can prove their explanation is correct.

This reminds me of a phenomenon I repeatedly observed while working as a strategy consultant at SDTI.

Clients often asked us: "Will this market trend continue?" "Will our digital transformation investment pay off?" "Will our competitor's strategy succeed?"

These questions share a common assumption: that the future is predictable.

I've seen too many companies spend vast resources creating beautiful five-year plans, only to be slapped by the market in the first year. Not because the planning was poor—the analysis was solid, logic clear, data sufficient—but because reality never cooperates with your Excel.

Companies make structurally identical mistakes to investors: over-trusting their own judgment and underestimating system complexity.

A financial analyst looking at a hundred indicators thinks they understand markets. A company CEO reading five industry reports thinks they understand trends. But markets and trends aren't linear systems—they're complex adaptive systems where variables influence each other, feedback loops nest within layers, and tiny perturbations can trigger chain reactions.

You can understand certain parts of a system, but you cannot predict the trajectory of the whole. This isn't a problem of insufficient intelligence, but an inherent characteristic of the system itself.

The 2008 financial crisis is the perfect example.

Before the tsunami, Wall Street's brightest minds—PhDs from top universities, students of Nobel Prize-winning economists—designed sophisticated financial models that told everyone risk had been dispersed, hedged, and controlled. Subprime mortgages were packaged into CDOs, CDOs were rated AAA, credit default swaps (CDS) were treated as insurance—everything was under mathematical model control.

Until it wasn't.

The week Lehman Brothers collapsed, the global financial system nearly disintegrated within forty-eight hours. Those sophisticated models didn't predict this scenario because their assumption of "normal market conditions" was itself an illusion. Market behavior under extreme conditions is completely different from normal conditions—and extreme conditions are precisely when you need models most.

This isn't mocking those financial engineers. They were indeed smart, their models were indeed effective most of the time. But "effective most of the time" and "effective at critical moments" are different things. And markets only determine life and death at critical moments.

Back to the 2017 market highs.

The most mainstream narratives then came in two flavors: optimists saying "economic fundamentals improved, this rally has real support"; pessimists saying "it's all a bubble propped up by money printing, bound to collapse eventually."

Looking back (I'm writing this in 2026), both sides were partially right and partially wrong. Markets did crash in 2020 due to the pandemic—but not because bubbles burst, but because of a black swan. Then after governments unleashed even larger-scale money printing, markets soared to even higher levels.

If you made any judgment in 2017 based on "I know what will happen"—whether bullish or bearish—you were probably wrong. Not wrong about direction, but wrong about path. Markets eventually went where you expected, but took a completely different route than you imagined.

This is why I increasingly don't believe in prediction and increasingly believe in preparation.

I'm not saying "do nothing." Inaction isn't humility, it's surrender.

What I mean is: true wisdom isn't knowing answers, but admitting you don't know—then making the best preparations under the premise of not knowing.

For investors, this means diversified allocation, controlled exposure, not betting everything on any single judgment. These aren't sophisticated strategies, they're basic survival disciplines.

For companies, this means strategic planning must have flexibility, organizational structures must adjust quickly, don't put all resources on one "I think this will happen" scenario.

For individuals, this means—

Admitting you don't know what will happen tomorrow. This isn't weakness, it's honesty. Then carrying this honesty forward, continuing to live seriously, choose seriously, take responsibility seriously.

Market rises and falls have nothing to do with which party governs, nothing to do with your political leanings, your beliefs, your education. It's a torrent that transcends geography and politics. Facing an unfathomable future, facing the intricate complexities of global capital dynamics—

It's hard not to be humble.
