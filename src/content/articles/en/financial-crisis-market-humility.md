title: "Reverence for the Unknown Surge: Ten Years of Market Lessons from the Financial Crisis"
subtitle: "We know too much, understand too little — the market taught me not how to predict, but how to be humble"
description: "In 2017, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, Taiwan's stock index reached a five-year high, and the Dow Jones broke through 23,000. Global markets were euphoric. But what was fueling the market — genuine economic recovery, or rivers of liquidity created by global central banks printing money? There is no standard answer to this question, and 'having no standard answer' itself is the most important lesson. The market is not a physical system; it does not obey Newton's laws. Facing capital surges and complex economic systems, the only stance we can hold is humility before the unknown."
abstract: |
  Over the ten years from 2008's financial crisis to 2017's market peaks, Paul personally experienced the cognitive dissonance of "being bearish while everything kept rising." Those who shorted were swept out of the market; those who held on didn't always understand why they were making money. This piece is not investment advice, but the reflection of someone who learned humility in the market — from experience serving clients at SDTI, Paul discovered that the mistakes enterprises and investors make are remarkably similar: overestimating their own judgment and underestimating system complexity. True wisdom is not knowing the answer, but admitting you don't know.

In October 2017, Taiwan's weighted stock index reached 10,700, a five-year high.

If you had been bearish on the market since the 2008 financial crisis—and believe me, many smart people were—then by 2017, the market had been slapping you in the face for nearly a decade. Every time you thought "this rally has topped out," the market would respond with a new red candlestick telling you: your judgment, it doesn't care.

This is not unique to Taiwan. Across the Pacific, the Dow Jones broke through 23,000, an all-time high. South Korea's KOSPI hovered near multi-year peaks. The global market narrative was synchronized: up.

Those who went short had been forced to cover so many times, they'd lost count.

But what was actually fueling this rally?

On the surface, it was the prospect of economic recovery. After 2008, governments worldwide launched unprecedented fiscal stimulus and monetary easing programs. Economic data improved year over year, employment recovered, corporate profits grew — every indicator said "the worst is behind us."

But if you peel back one layer of skin, you see another story: global central banks were printing money like crazy.

The Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE), the European Central Bank's negative interest rates, Abenomics with its three arrows — these policies created trillions of liquidity. Excess capital desperately needed a harbor. Stock markets, real estate, bonds, even cryptocurrencies — every asset class was inflated by surplus liquidity.

So the question became: Is the market rising because the economy really improved, or because there's too much money?

Honestly, nobody knows. Or more accurately: everyone has an explanation, but nobody can prove theirs is right.

This reminds me of a phenomenon I repeatedly observed while working as a strategy consultant at SDTI.

Clients would always ask us: "Will this market trend continue?" "Will our digital transformation investment pay off?" "Will our competitor's strategy succeed?"

What these questions have in common is that they assume the future is predictable.

I've seen countless enterprises spend enormous resources creating beautiful five-year plans, only to have the market prove them wrong in year one. Not because the planning was poor — the analysis was solid, the logic clear, the data abundant — but because reality never cooperates with your Excel spreadsheet.

The mistakes enterprises make and the mistakes investors make are structurally identical: overestimating your own judgment and underestimating system complexity.

A financial analyst stares at a hundred indicators and thinks they understand the market. A CEO reads five industry reports and thinks they understand the trend. But markets and trends are not linear systems — they are complex adaptive systems where variables influence each other, feedback loops nest within each other, and a tiny disturbance can trigger a chain reaction.

You can understand some local parts of the system, but you cannot predict the overall trajectory. This isn't a matter of not being smart enough; it's the system's inherent nature.

The 2008 financial crisis is the perfect example.

Before the crisis, Wall Street's brightest minds — PhDs from top universities, students of Nobel Prize winners — designed sophisticated financial models that told everyone risk was dispersed, hedged, controlled. Subprime mortgages were packaged into CDOs, CDOs were rated AAA, credit default swaps were treated like insurance — everything was under mathematical control.

Until it wasn't.

In the week Lehman Brothers collapsed, the global financial system nearly imploded in forty-eight hours. Those sophisticated models didn't predict this because the "normal market conditions" they assumed was itself an illusion. Market behavior in extreme situations is completely different from normal times — and extreme situations are precisely when you need your model to work.

This isn't mocking the financial engineers. They really were smart, and their models really did work most of the time. But "works most of the time" and "works at critical moments" are different things. And the market only decides life and death at critical moments.

Back to the 2017 market peaks.

The two dominant narratives at the time were: optimists saying "fundamental economics have improved, this rally has real support," and pessimists saying "it's all just money printing creating bubbles that will eventually burst."

Looking back (I'm writing this in 2026), both sides were partially right and partially wrong. Markets did crash in 2020 because of the pandemic — but not because bubbles burst; because of a black swan. Then, after governments engaged in even larger stimulus spending, markets soared to even higher levels.

If you made any judgment in 2017 based on "I know what will happen" — whether bullish or bearish — you were almost certainly wrong. Not wrong about direction, but wrong about the path. The market may have ended up where you expected, but took a completely different route to get there.

This is why I increasingly don't believe in prediction; I believe in preparation.

I'm not saying "do nothing." Inaction is not humility; it's surrender.

What I mean is: true wisdom is not knowing the answer, but admitting you don't know — and then, from that place of not knowing, making the best preparations you can.

For investors, this means diversified allocation, controlled exposure, and never betting your life savings on any single judgment. These aren't sophisticated strategies; they're basic survival discipline.

For enterprises, this means strategic planning with flexibility, organizational structures that can adjust quickly, and not deploying all resources toward one scenario you think will happen.

For individuals, this means —

Admitting you don't know what will happen tomorrow. This is not weakness; it's honesty. Then, carrying that honesty with you, continue living seriously, making choices seriously, bearing responsibility seriously.

Market rises and falls have nothing to do with which party is in power, nothing to do with your political leanings, your beliefs, or your education. It is a force that transcends geography and politics. Facing a future we cannot fathom, facing the intricate tangle of global capital flows —

How can we not be humble?
