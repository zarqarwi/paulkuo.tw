## Digital Footprints and the Invisible Web
### When Life is Quietly Taken Over by Algorithms

After using MOVES and LARK for six months,
I discovered that activity tracking tools that previously required deliberate planning were now being implemented in a completely natural and painless way.

Opening my phone,
it precisely estimated my sleep and wake times, and even began offering suggestions for my daily life.

The system has certainly recorded the places I frequent.
In the future, if an app could analyze where I hold meetings and whom I interact with, it wouldn't be surprising at all.

### Algorithms Know You Better Than You Do

Life data has already been organized through smartphones and sent up to the cloud,
becoming part of "THE ONE" system.

This brings a harsh reality:

- I might not know my own work productivity, but the app does. It can calculate how many words I've written and how many meetings I've attended in a week.
- My understanding of my own sleep and health condition might not match that of LARK or Apple.
- My assessment of my own social influence definitely can't compare to Facebook, which is already counting my weekly likes.

Perhaps within our lifetime,
we will see AI advance rapidly, replacing tedious HR and team building work.

### The Paradigm Intersection of Boiling Frogs

For the internet-native generation, feeding digital footprints to the system and letting it understand you is a natural way of life.
But for humans who once lived in the "pre-internet era," this creates enormous tension.

We live in a space-time of intersecting paradigms.
This is a battle over resource allocation and value recognition.

What kind of data constitutes privacy?
What kind of privacy do we need?
How should we view our relationship with THE ONE system?

I feel like a frog living in a pot of boiling water.
Somewhat accustomed to it.
Yet finding it somewhat strange.
But unable to articulate what exactly is strange about it.
