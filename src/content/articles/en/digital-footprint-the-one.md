# Digital Footprints and the Invisible Web
## When Life is Quietly Taken Over by Algorithms

After using MOVES and LARK for six months,
I've discovered that what once required deliberate planning—activity tracking tools—is now being implemented in a completely natural and painless manner.

I open my phone.
It precisely estimates my sleep and wake times, even beginning to offer advice about my daily life.

The system certainly records the places I frequent.
In the future, if an app could analyze where I hold meetings and with whom I interact, it wouldn't be surprising at all.

## Algorithms Know You Better Than You Know Yourself

Life data is already being organized through phones and uploaded to the cloud,
becoming part of "THE ONE" system.

This brings us a harsh reality:

- I might not know my own work productivity, but apps do. They can calculate how many words I wrote in a week, how many meetings I attended.
- My understanding of my own sleep and health conditions might not compare to LARK or Apple's.
- My assessment of my own social influence definitely can't match Facebook, which is already tallying my weekly likes.

Perhaps in our lifetime,
we'll witness AI rapidly advancing to replace tedious HR and Team Building work.

## Boiling Frogs in Paradigmatic Transition

For the internet-native generation, feeding digital traces to the system and letting it understand you is a natural way of life.
But for humans who once lived in "the age without internet," this creates enormous tension.

We live in a space-time of paradigmatic transition.
This is a battle over resource allocation and value recognition.

What kind of data constitutes privacy?
What kind of privacy do we need?
How should we view our relationship with THE ONE system?

I feel like a frog living in a pot of boiling water.
Somewhat accustomed to it.
Yet finding it somewhat strange.
But unable to articulate where the strangeness lies.
