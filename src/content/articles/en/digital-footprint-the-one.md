## Digital Footprints and the Invisible Web
### When Life Is Quietly Taken Over by Algorithms

After using MOVES and LARK for half a year,
I discovered that activity tracking tools that previously required deliberate planning were now being implemented in a completely natural and painless state.

Opening my phone,
it precisely calculated my sleep and wake times, even beginning to offer advice about my daily life.

The system certainly recorded the places I frequented as well.
In the future, if an app could analyze where I hold meetings and with whom I interact, it wouldn't be surprising at all.

### Algorithms Know You Better Than You Do

Life data has already been organized through smartphones and sent to the cloud,
becoming part of "THE ONE" system.

This brings a harsh reality:

- I might not know my work productivity, but the app does. It can calculate how many words I wrote in a week, how many meetings I attended.
- My understanding of my own sleep and health conditions might not compare to LARK or Apple's.
- My assessment of my own social influence definitely can't match Facebook, which is already tallying my weekly likes.

Perhaps in our lifetime,
we'll see AI advance rapidly, replacing tedious HR and team building work.

### The Paradigm Shift of Boiling Frogs

For digital natives, feeding digital footprints to the system and letting it understand you is a natural way of life.
But for humans who once lived in the "pre-internet era," this represents an enormous tension.

We live in a space-time of paradigm intersection.
This is a battle over resource allocation and value identification.

What kind of data constitutes privacy?
What kind of privacy do we need?
How should we view our relationship with THE ONE system?

I feel like a frog living in a pot of boiling water.
Somewhat accustomed to it.
Yet finding it somewhat strange.
But unable to articulate what's strange about it.
