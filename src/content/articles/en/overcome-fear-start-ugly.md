Most failures have little to do with how smart someone is. What truly holds people back is being defeated by fear before they even begin. Mental resilience is the operating system that determines how far a person can go.

## Why We Experience Fear

Fear was originally a good thing—tens of thousands of years ago, when you saw a wild beast, adrenaline surged, you ran, and you survived. But where are the wild beasts now? Our brains are still running the old firmware of "being abandoned by the tribe means starvation," applying it to a work email, a rejected proposal, or an awkward social situation. This is a serious misalignment between biological instinct and modern society. In reality, even if you offend most people, as long as you have capability, nothing significant will happen to you.

Except for life and death, all other fears are illusions manufactured by the brain. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of what others think of you—these aren't real threats. You've magnified the world's difficulty tenfold, then deified the rules and trapped yourself. Psychological overload is the invisible prison of mediocrity.

## Ways to Break Free from Fear

First, "demystify" the strong. The habit of seeing others as big and yourself as small is the main cause of confidence loss. The rise of any strong person is essentially the result of timing and foundational resources working together. Strip away the halo and everyone is ordinary. Don't let others' light extinguish your own lamp. If you're in the accumulation phase, all your energy should go toward lighting yourself up. Everyone has their own rhythm—viewing others as equals helps you regain home field advantage.

Second, start first—ugly posture doesn't matter. The difference between winners and the mediocre lies in 0.1 seconds—the mediocre wait for "foolproof conditions," while winners choose to "make something crappy first." Once you start moving, 50% of problems disappear automatically, and the remaining 50% will grow their own solutions during the process. Resources aren't waited for—they're attracted by your energy when you charge forward.

Third, spiritual independence. Switch from "seeking approval" to "self-upgrading." This is the realm described in the I Ching—even when misunderstood, the heart remains untroubled. When your life's main thread changes from "pleasing others" to "self-evolution," fear automatically dissipates: dare to express because you no longer fear judgment; can enter the game because you no longer obsess over gains and losses; dare to persist because you know destiny is forged through collision.

## From Personal Psychology to Systems Thinking

This is the same as entrepreneurship. In circular economy, there's a concept called "minimum viable loop"—you don't need to wait for a perfect recycling system to begin. You run a rough cycle first and optimize while operating. Mental construction works the same way: don't wait until you're "ready" to set out. Get yourself spinning first—adjusting in motion is a hundred times more effective than planning in stillness. This is even more true in the AI era—something you spend three months planning might see the world turn 30 times over. Taking action first isn't compromise—it's rational strategy.

The braver you are, the gentler the world becomes; the stronger you are, the fairer the world becomes. Seeing through fear's underlying logic—that it's an outdated survival program, not your actual situation—is the opening move to breaking through destiny's limitations.
