title: "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Stepping Stones Model and the True Trajectory of Entrepreneurship"
subtitle: "My twenty years of entrepreneurship are living proof of this book"
description: "Goal-oriented thinking is a trap. Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman's 'Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned' reveals a counterintuitive truth: from microwaves to GPUs, from Mozart to Kodak, all world-changing discoveries emerged not from pursuing predetermined goals, but from following interests. Paul's entrepreneurial journey—from iShelly to nvesto to CircleFlow—perfectly validates the Stepping Stones model."

  Goal-oriented planning is the enemy of innovation. This article introduces Kenneth Stanley & Joel Lehman's core theory from "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned": the Stepping Stones model and Novelty Search algorithm. From historical cases (Wright brothers, microwaves, GPUs) to reflections on national policy, and validation through Paul Kuo's twenty years of entrepreneurial practice, it reveals an uncomfortable truth: what truly changes the world are often the steps considered "furthest from the goal."

  Perfect for entrepreneurs, leaders, and anyone who feels that "five-year plans are fundamentally unrealistic."

You're appointed as Minister of Technology. Everyone in the conference room holds perfect strategy documents with dense execution pathways and clear KPIs. You feel slightly uneasy but begin signing off: "Let's do this."

Six months later, you discover all plans are on track, but nothing exciting is happening. Damn it, you can't explain why—all indicators are green.

Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman use a programming example to explain why. They ask: If you want to evolve an AI that can achieve a completely specific goal (like navigating through a maze fastest), what's the most effective method?

The intuitive answer: directly optimize for this goal. Select mutations that get closer to the finish line with each step.

In reality? These directly optimized AIs often get stuck in local optima, never finding the real exit. Because every step moves in the seemingly correct direction, there's no motivation to explore areas that "appear to be detours"—yet precisely those detour areas can bypass dead ends.

Now reverse it. What if instead of directly optimizing "escape the maze," you optimize for "explore the most new states" (Novelty Search)?

Something strange happens. The AI starts wandering randomly. It enters dead ends, then exits. It explores corners, corridors, various lengthy routes. In pursuing "novelty," it accidentally discovers a direct path to the exit—a path it would never have found through direct optimization.

This experiment later changed Stanley's view of human history.

## Turning Points in the Story

"Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned" uses historical cases to validate Novelty Search. The case selection is unbeatable:

**The Wright Brothers.** They wanted to build airplanes, but spent time not on engine engineering, but studying ribbon behavior in wind tunnel experiments. Those seemingly completely unrelated experiments became the foundation for their later ability to control flight. Every "plan deviation" experiment was a stepping stone to eventual success.

**The Microwave Oven.** Percy Spencer, working at a radar company, discovered microwaves could melt chocolate. That wasn't his goal. The goal was developing better radar. But this "accidental discovery" later changed every household kitchen.

**GPUs.** The video game industry needed faster graphics processing, driving GPU development. No one in the 1990s said: "We need GPUs to train large neural networks." But those chips optimized for gaming later became the infrastructure for deep learning.

The common thread? All achievers were pursuing some point of interest, then led in completely different directions. Every "deviation" wasn't waste, but construction of a possibility space.

This isn't feel-good advice. This is a mathematically verifiable pattern: **Systems using Novelty Search often discover more powerful solutions than systems using Goal Search.**

## From Policy to Personal

The book's middle section contains an unsettling chapter: education policy.

Governments worldwide are doing the same thing—defining "success," then designing education systems to maximize these success metrics. Test scores, college admission rates, employment rates. Each can be measured, so it appears scientific.

But what's the result? They've cultivated a generation skilled at walking pre-planned routes, yet unable to innovate when encountering problems without preset paths.

Stanley's argument: If you truly want to educate creative people, you need to let them explore. Let them "waste time" on seemingly unrelated projects. Let them pursue quirky interests, even if these interests aren't in the curriculum.

This completely contradicts modern corporate doctrine. Modern enterprises say: focus. Set goals. Every minute should advance toward the goal.

Stanley's response: Such focus traps you in local optima, never to escape.

## My Own Three Stepping Stones

Reading this book, I was re-examining my own twenty-year entrepreneurial trajectory. Honestly, I didn't start with a "five-year plan." I had some intuitions and interests.

**First Stepping Stone: iShelly.** Online financial media. Strictly speaking, this differed from everything I later did. But what did I learn in that process? Web traffic, content marketing, community management. These skills were used in every subsequent project.

**Second Stepping Stone: nvesto.** From financial media to investment consulting. On the surface it appeared to "deepen" the finance field, but actually I was exploring a completely different business model—from advertising-driven to consulting-driven. It failed, but that failure taught me the real cost of client trust, and why professional services can't use media logic.

**Third Stepping Stone: Food Machine, Hopemarket, BanDo.** Suddenly jumping to agri-food ecosystems. It seemed like wasting my accumulated finance expertise. But in that process I understood what real supply chains are, farmers' real situations, what "changing an ecosystem's difficulty" means.

**Now: CircleFlow.** Circular economy digitalization. Why can I see what others can't? Because I walked those circuitous routes. Finance×Agriculture×Construction×AI. Every "digression" is the foundation for seeing at this moment.

If I had "planned" twenty years ago to become a circular economy AI expert, I would have missed all these stepping stones. I would be like a fake expert, knowing only surface knowledge without real touch.

## Why Organizations Become Death Mechanisms

Stanley's sharpest criticism: **Goal-oriented systems naturally oppose novelty.**

In highly goal-oriented organizations, people who "deviate from goals" are considered unprofessional. "Wasting time" on seemingly unrelated projects is seen as laziness. Cross-boundary experimentation is viewed as distraction.

Yet precisely in these activities that organizations despise, real innovation emerges.

So the more successful large organizations become, the more they set clear goals, the harder it becomes to produce game-changing innovation. They become highly optimized systems, perfectly solving past problems, but defenseless against future problems.

This explains why Kodak (originally an imaging company) didn't invent digital cameras—not a technical problem, but a clear, definite goal (maximizing film camera market share) that eliminated motivation to explore new possibilities.

## Treasure Hunter Mentality

Stanley uses an analogy: goal-oriented people are measuring tapes. They know where the destination is, the straight-line distance, wanting only the fastest arrival.

Innovators are treasure hunters. They have curiosity and adventurous spirit. They don't know where treasure is, but walking along, they discover better things.

This doesn't mean having no goals. Rather: **The best goals often come from possibilities accidentally discovered in the process, not predetermined at the starting point.**

In the circular economy field, what I'm now doing—urban mining digitalization, material flow tracking, carbon footprint visualization—no one said ten years ago "this will change the world." These all emerged as opportunities through interacting with actual cases, failing, correcting, exploring.

My hypothesis wasn't "I want to change the circular economy." The hypothesis was "this field is interesting, let me see what I can discover." The results far exceeded initial imagination.

## Uncomfortable Implications

Pushing Stanley's logic to its conclusion yields an unsettling conclusion:

**If you can completely plan your success, your ambitions might be too small.**

True greatness often looks like waste. Looks inefficient. Looks like taking the long way.

This means if you want to build an organization that can produce real innovation, you must give people permission to "waste time." You must reward novelty, not just progress. You must trust stepping stones, even when they seem completely unrelated in the short term.

Google's 20% time policy (employees can spend 20% of work time on any project) was once mocked as waste. But Gmail and Google Maps came from this 20%. It's like organized Novelty Search.

More radical application: VC investment. The best startup investments might not be teams with clear business plans, but entrepreneurs with "interesting ideas, temporarily without clear exits." Because precisely in pursuing what's interesting, they'll discover opportunities that "planning-type" entrepreneurs never see.

## Conclusion: Abandon the Map, Bring a Compass

Stanley's final line is simple: **Stop planning what your life should become, start pursuing what gives you energy.**

This isn't motivational fluff. This is mathematically grounded advice.

Multiple experiments prove Novelty Search discovers more powerful solutions than Goal Search. Pursuing novelty goes further than straight-line goal pursuit.

My twenty years of entrepreneurial experience confirms this. Every decision that most seemed like "waste" later became the most valuable asset.

So if you're now at some life crossroads—unsure whether to "stick to the plan" or "pursue interests":

Please choose interests. Find those stepping stones that seem outside the plan but truly make you curious.

Everyone in history who changed the world was walking such paths. Not the shortest path, but the most interesting path.

And interesting is often the only direction toward greatness.
