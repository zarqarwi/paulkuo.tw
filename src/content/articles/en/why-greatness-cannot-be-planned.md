subtitle: "My twenty years of entrepreneurship is living proof of this book"
description: "Goal-oriented thinking is a trap. Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman's 'Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned' reveals a counterintuitive truth: from microwaves to GPUs, from Mozart to Kodak, all world-changing discoveries emerged while pursuing interests, not predetermined goals. Paul's entrepreneurial journey—from iShelly to nvesto to CircleFlow—perfectly validates the Stepping Stones model."

  Goal-oriented planning is the enemy of innovation. This article introduces Kenneth Stanley & Joel Lehman's core theory from "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned": the Stepping Stones model and Novelty Search algorithm. From historical cases (Wright brothers, microwave ovens, GPUs) to reflections on national policy, and Paul Kuo's twenty years of entrepreneurial practice as validation, revealing an uncomfortable truth: what truly changes the world are often those steps considered "furthest from the goal."

  Perfect for entrepreneurs, leaders, and anyone who feels that "five-year plans are completely unrealistic."

You've been appointed as Minister of Technology. Everyone in the meeting room holds perfect strategy documents, dense execution pathways, clear KPIs. You feel slightly uneasy but begin signing off: "Let's do this."

Six months later, you discover all plans are on track, but nothing exciting is happening. Damn it, you can't explain why—all metrics are green.

Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman use a programming example to illustrate why. They ask: If you want to evolve an AI that can pass a completely specific goal (like traversing a maze fastest), what's the most effective method?

The intuitive answer: directly optimize for this goal. Select mutations that get closer to the finish line with each step.

In reality? These directly optimizing AIs often get stuck in local optima, never finding the real exit. Because each step heads in the seemingly correct direction, there's no motivation to explore those "seemingly roundabout" places—yet precisely those roundabout places can bypass dead ends.

Now reverse it. What if instead of directly optimizing "exit the maze," you optimize for "exploring the most new states" (Novelty Search)?

Something strange happens. The AI begins wandering randomly. It enters dead ends, then exits. It explores corners, corridors, all sorts of lengthy routes. In pursuing "novelty," it accidentally discovers a direct path to the exit—a path it would never have found through direct optimization.

This experiment later changed Stanley's view of human history.

## Turning Points in the Story

"Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned" uses historical cases to validate Novelty Search. The case selection is unbeatable:

**The Wright Brothers.** They wanted to build airplanes, but spent time not on engine engineering, but in wind tunnel experiments studying wing shapes and airflow behavior. Those seemingly completely unrelated experiments became the foundation for their later ability to control flight. Every "deviation from plan" experiment was a stepping stone to later success.

**The Microwave Oven.** Percy Spencer, working at a radar company, discovered microwaves could melt chocolate. That wasn't his goal. The goal was developing better radar. But this "accidental discovery" later transformed every household kitchen.

**GPUs.** The gaming industry needed faster graphics processing, driving GPU development. No one in the 1990s said: "We need GPUs to train large neural networks." But those chips optimized for games later became the infrastructure for deep learning.

The common thread? All achievers were pursuing some point of interest, then got led in completely different directions. Each "deviation" wasn't waste, but construction of a possibility space.

This isn't feel-good fluff. This is a mathematically verifiable pattern: **Systems using Novelty Search often discover more powerful solutions than systems using Goal Search.**

## From Policy to Personal

The book's middle section has an unsettling chapter: educational policy.

Governments worldwide are doing the same thing—defining "success," then designing educational systems to maximize this success metric. Test scores, college admission rates, employment rates. Each measurable, so seemingly scientific.

But what's the result? They've cultivated a generation excellent at walking predetermined routes, but lacking the ability to innovate when encountering problems without preset pathways.

Stanley's argument: If you truly want to educate creative people, you need to let them explore. Let them "waste time" on seemingly unrelated projects. Let them pursue odd interests, even when these interests aren't in the curriculum.

This completely contradicts modern corporate doctrine. Modern corporations say: focus. Set goals. Every minute should advance toward the goal.

Stanley's response: Such focus traps you in local optima, never to escape.

## My Own Three Stepping Stones

Reading this book, I re-examined my twenty years of entrepreneurial trajectory. Frankly, I didn't start with a "five-year plan." I had a series of intuitions and interests.

**First Stepping Stone: iShelly.** Online financial media. Strictly speaking, unlike anything I did later. But what did I learn in that process? Web traffic, content marketing, community management. These skills were used in every subsequent project.

**Second Stepping Stone: nvesto.** From financial media to investment consulting. Superficially "deepening" the financial field, but actually exploring a completely different business model—from advertising-driven to consulting-driven. It failed, but that failure taught me the real cost of client trust, and why professional services can't use media logic.

**Third Stepping Stone: Good Food Machine, Haolife Market, Bio-Architecture Formosana.** Suddenly jumping to agri-food ecosystems. Seemed like wasting expertise accumulated in finance. But in that process I understood real supply chains, farmers' real situations, the difficulty of "changing an ecosystem."

**Now: CircleFlow.** Circular economy digitalization. Why can I see things others can't? Because I walked those circuitous paths. Finance × Agri-food × Construction × AI. Each "digression" is the foundation for what I can see at this moment.

If I had "planned" twenty years ago to become a circular economy AI expert, I would have missed all these stepping stones. I'd be like a fake expert, knowing only surface knowledge, without real tactile understanding.

## Why Organizations Become Death Mechanisms

Stanley's sharpest critique: **Goal-oriented systems naturally oppose novelty.**

In highly goal-oriented organizations, people who "deviate from goals" are considered unprofessional. "Wasting time" on seemingly unrelated projects is seen as laziness. Cross-boundary experiments are viewed as distraction.

Yet precisely in these activities that organizations despise, real innovation emerges.

So the more successful large organizations become, the more they set clear goals, the harder it becomes to generate game-changing innovation. They become highly optimized systems, perfectly solving yesterday's problems, but with no defense against tomorrow's problems.

This explains why Kodak engineers invented the world's first digital camera as early as 1975, yet the company refused commercialization—not a technical problem, but a clear, definite goal (maximize film market) that eliminated motivation to explore new possibilities. They personally created the technology to disrupt themselves, yet remained blind due to goal-oriented thinking.

## Treasure Hunter Mentality

Stanley uses a metaphor: goal-oriented people are measuring tapes. They know where the destination is, the straight-line distance, wanting only the fastest arrival.

Innovators are treasure hunters. They have curiosity, adventurous spirit. They don't know where treasure lies, but walking along, they discover better things.

This doesn't mean having no goals. Rather: **The best goals often come from possibilities accidentally discovered in the process, not predetermined at the starting point.**

In the circular economy field, what I'm doing now—urban mining digitalization, material flow tracking, carbon footprint visualization—no one said ten years ago "this will change the world." These all emerged from interacting with actual cases, failing, correcting, exploring.

My hypothesis wasn't "I want to change the circular economy." The hypothesis was "this field is interesting, let me see what I can discover." The results far exceeded initial imagination.

## Uncomfortable Implications

Stanley's logic, taken to its conclusion, yields an unsettling conclusion:

**If you can completely plan your success, your ambitions might be too small.**

True greatness often looks like waste. Looks inefficient. Looks like taking detours.

This means, if you want to build an organization capable of genuine innovation, you must give people licenses to "waste time." You must reward novelty, not just progress. You must trust stepping stones, even when they seem completely unrelated in the short term.

Google's 20% time policy (employees can spend 20% of work time on any project) was once mocked as wasteful. But Gmail, AdSense both came from that 20%. It's like organized Novelty Search.

More radical application: VC investment. The best startup investments might not be teams with clear business plans, but entrepreneurs with "interesting ideas, temporarily without clear exits." Because precisely in pursuing the interesting, they'll discover opportunities that "planning-type" entrepreneurs never see.

## Conclusion: Abandon the Map, Carry a Compass

Stanley's final line is simple: **Stop planning what your life should become, start pursuing what makes you feel alive.**

This isn't motivational fluff. This is mathematically grounded advice.

Multiple experiments prove Novelty Search discovers more powerful solutions than Goal Search. Pursuing novelty goes farther than straight lines toward goals.

My twenty years of entrepreneurial experience confirms this. Every decision that seemed most like "waste" later became the most valuable asset.

So, if you're now at some life crossroads—unsure whether to "stick to the plan" or "follow interests":

Please choose interests. Find those stepping stones that seem outside the plan, but genuinely make you curious.

Everyone in history who changed the world walked such paths. Not the shortest path, but the most interesting path.

And interesting is often the only direction toward greatness.
