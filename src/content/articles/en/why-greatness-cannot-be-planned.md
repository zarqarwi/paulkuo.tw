subtitle: "My twenty years of entrepreneurship is living proof of this book"
description: "Goal-oriented thinking is a trap. Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman's 'Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned' reveals a counterintuitive truth: from microwaves to GPUs, from Mozart to Kodak, all world-changing discoveries emerged from pursuing interests, not predetermined goals. Paul's entrepreneurial journey—from iShelly to nvesto to our AI platform—perfectly validates the Stepping Stones model."

  Goal-oriented planning is the enemy of innovation. This article introduces the core theory of Kenneth Stanley & Joel Lehman's "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned": the Stepping Stones model and Novelty Search algorithm. From historical cases (Wright brothers, microwave ovens, GPUs) to reflections on national policy, to Paul Kuo's twenty years of entrepreneurial practice, revealing an uncomfortable truth: what truly changes the world are often the steps considered "furthest from the goal."

You've been appointed as Minister of Technology. Everyone in the meeting room holds perfect strategy documents, densely packed execution pathways, clear KPIs. You feel slightly uneasy inside, but begin signing off: "Let's do this."

Six months later, you discover all plans are on track, but nothing exciting is happening. Damn it, you can't explain why—all metrics are green.

Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman use a programming example to explain why. They ask: If you want to evolve an AI that can achieve a completely specific goal (like navigating through a maze fastest), what's the most effective method?

The intuitive answer: directly optimize for this goal. Select mutations that get closer to the finish line with each step.

In reality? These directly optimizing AIs often get stuck in local optima, never finding the real exit. Because every step moves in a seemingly correct direction, there's no motivation to explore areas that "appear to be detours"—yet precisely those detour areas enable bypassing dead ends.

Now flip it around. What if instead of directly optimizing "escaping the maze," you optimize for "exploring the most new states" (Novelty Search)?

Something strange happens. The AI starts wandering randomly. It enters dead ends, then exits. It explores corners, corridors, all sorts of lengthy routes. In pursuing "novelty," it accidentally discovers a direct path to the exit—a path it would never have found through direct optimization.

This experiment later changed Stanley's view of human history.

## Turning Points in the Story

"Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned" validates Novelty Search through historical cases. The case selection is unbeatable:

**The Wright Brothers.** They wanted to build airplanes, but spent time not on engine engineering, but in wind tunnel experiments studying wing shapes and airflow behavior. Those seemingly completely unrelated experiments became the foundation for their later ability to control flight. Every "deviation from plan" experiment was a stepping stone to later success.

**The Microwave Oven.** Percy Spencer, working at a radar company, discovered that microwaves could melt chocolate. That wasn't his goal. The goal was developing better radar. But this "accidental discovery" later changed every household kitchen.

**GPUs.** The video game industry needed faster graphics processing, driving GPU development. No one in the 1990s said: "We need GPUs to train large neural networks." But those chips optimized for gaming later became the infrastructure for deep learning.

The common thread? All achievers were pursuing some point of interest, then were led in completely different directions. Every "deviation" wasn't waste, but was constructing a possibility space.

This isn't motivational fluff. This is a mathematically verifiable pattern: **Systems using Novelty Search often discover more powerful solutions than systems using Goal Search.**

## From Policy to Personal

The book has a disturbing middle chapter: educational policy.

Governments worldwide are doing the same thing—defining "success," then designing educational systems to maximize this success metric. Test scores, college admission rates, employment rates. Each is measurable, so appears scientific.

But what's the result? They've cultivated a generation skilled at walking pre-planned routes, yet lacking ability to innovate when encountering problems without preset solutions.

Stanley's argument: If you truly want to educate creative people, you need to let them explore. Let them "waste time" on seemingly unrelated projects. Let them pursue quirky interests, even when these interests aren't in the curriculum.

This completely contradicts modern corporate doctrine. Modern corporations say: focus. Set goals. Every minute should advance toward the goal.

Stanley's response: Such focus traps you in local optima, from which you can never escape.

## My Own Three Stepping Stones

Reading this book, I was re-examining my own twenty years of entrepreneurial trajectory. Frankly, I didn't start with a "five-year plan." I had a series of intuitions and interests.

**First Stepping Stone: iShelly.** Online financial media. Strictly speaking, this differed from everything I later did. But what did I learn in that process? Web traffic, content marketing, community management. These skills were used in every subsequent project.

**Second Stepping Stone: nvesto.** From financial media to investment consulting. Superficially a "deepening" of the financial field, but actually I was exploring a completely different business model—from advertising-driven to consulting-driven. It failed, but that failure taught me the real cost of client trust, and why professional services can't use media logic.

**Third Stepping Stone: Good Food Machine, Thick Life Market, Ban Mu Tang.** Suddenly jumping to agri-food ecosystems. Seemed like wasting my accumulated financial expertise. But in that process I understood what real supply chains are, what farmers' real situations are, what "the difficulty of changing an ecosystem" means.

**Now: our AI platform.** Circular economy digitalization. Why can I see things others can't? Because I walked those circuitous paths. Finance × Agri-food × Architecture × AI. Every "digression" is the foundation for what I can see at this moment.

If I had "planned" twenty years ago to become a circular economy AI expert, I would have missed all these stepping stones. I would have been like a fake expert, only understanding surface knowledge, lacking real tactile experience.

## Why Organizations Become Death Mechanisms

Stanley's sharpest criticism in the book: **Goal-oriented systems naturally oppose novelty.**

In a highly goal-oriented organization, people who "deviate from goals" are considered unprofessional. "Wasting time" on seemingly unrelated projects is seen as laziness. Cross-boundary experimentation is viewed as distraction.

Yet precisely in these activities that organizations despise, real innovation emerges.

So the more successful large organizations become, the more they set clear goals, the harder it becomes to produce game-changing innovation. They become highly optimized systems, perfectly solving past problems, but with no defense against future problems.

This explains why Kodak engineers invented the world's first digital camera as early as 1975, yet the company refused to commercialize it—not a technical problem, but a clear, definite goal (maximizing the film market) eliminated motivation to explore new possibilities. They personally created the technology that would disrupt themselves, yet remained blind to it due to goal-oriented thinking.

## Treasure Hunter Mentality

Stanley uses an analogy: Goal-oriented people are measuring tapes. They know where the destination is, the straight-line distance, and only want to arrive fastest.

Innovators are treasure hunters. They have curiosity, adventurous spirit. They don't know where treasure lies, but walking along, they discover better things.

This doesn't mean having no goals. Rather: **The best goals often come from possibilities accidentally discovered in the process, not predetermined at the starting point.**

In the circular economy field, what I'm doing now—urban mining digitalization, material flow tracking, carbon footprint visualization—no one said "this will change the world" ten years ago. These all emerged as opportunities through interacting with actual cases, failing, correcting, exploring.

My hypothesis wasn't "I want to change circular economy." The hypothesis was "this field is interesting, let me see what I can discover." The results far exceeded initial imagination.

## Uncomfortable Implications

Pushing Stanley's logic to its conclusion yields an unsettling conclusion:

**If you can completely plan your success, your ambitions might be too small.**

True greatness often looks like waste. Looks inefficient. Looks like taking detours.

This means, if you want to build an organization capable of genuine innovation, you must give people licenses to "waste time." You must reward novelty, not just progress. You must trust stepping stones, even when they appear completely unrelated in the short term.

Google's 20% time policy (employees can spend 20% of work time on any project) was once mocked as wasteful. But AdSense came from this 20% time (though Gmail is often mistakenly thought to be a 20% project, creator Paul Buchheit stated it wasn't). It was like organized Novelty Search.

More radical application: VC investment. The best startup investments might not be teams with clear business plans, but entrepreneurs with "interesting ideas, currently without clear exits." Because precisely in pursuing interesting paths, they'll discover opportunities that "planning-type" entrepreneurs never see.

## Conclusion: Abandon the Map, Bring a Compass

Stanley's final sentence is simple: **Stop planning what your life should become, start pursuing what makes you feel alive.**

This isn't motivational fluff. This is mathematically grounded advice.

Multiple experiments prove Novelty Search discovers more powerful solutions than Goal Search. Pursuing novelty goes further than straight-line charging toward goals.

My twenty years of entrepreneurial experience confirms this. Every decision that most looked like "waste" later became the most valuable asset.

So, if you're now at some crossroads in life—not knowing whether to "stick to the plan" or "pursue interests":

Please choose interests. Find those stepping stones that don't seem part of the plan, but genuinely make you curious.

Everyone in history who changed the world walked such paths. Not the shortest path, but the most interesting path.

And interesting is often the only direction toward greatness.
