title: "The Truth About Alternative Education: A Parent's Reflections and Gentle Resistance"
description: "Choosing alternative education isn't about finding shortcuts to college admission, but rather a reflection on and philosophical choice regarding industrial civilization and capitalist life. Alternative education is full of gray areas and uncertainty, severely testing parents' companionship and resilience. It absolutely cannot be approached with an 'outsourcing' mentality that shifts responsibility to institutions. When facing incompetent educators, parents must practice 'gentle and respectful resistance' together with their children, transforming setbacks and injustice into real learning nutrients, because without the courage to critique and resist, one cannot grow in a turbulent world."

## The Truth About Alternative Education
### A Parent's Reflections and Gentle Resistance

As a serial entrepreneur and father.
Being at the forefront of industry transformation, I deeply understand that education must adapt to accommodate environmental changes.

In 2015, we chose to have our child participate in non-school-based alternative education.
These are my reflections from several years of experience, for parents interested in alternative education:

### Stripping Away the Romantic Labels of Alternative Education

1. **It's companionship, not outsourcing**: Parents need to invest substantial time. It's not about throwing money to "outsource" education to institutions or consultants.
2. **It's not a shortcut to college**: If you still believe in exam-oriented education, staying within the traditional system is better—lower communication costs, higher efficiency.
3. **It's co-entrepreneurship**: Alternative education is a journey of co-creation with your child, where the curriculum is the product and the child is the user.
4. **Extremely high uncertainty**: Legal approval doesn't equal systemic perfection. Alternative education is a system full of gray areas, testing students' character and challenging parents' nerves.

Choosing alternative education stems from reflection on industrial civilization and capitalist life.
It's a decision based on educational beliefs and philosophy, not merely methodology.
Whenever I see people proudly waving their depreciating diplomas, gleeful about getting into top universities, I can't help but feel like "sir, I think you've entered the wrong room."

### Gentle and Respectful Resistance

The true meaning of learning in daily life is: regardless of what situation you encounter, there's always an opportunity to transform it into learning nutrients.
Complaining is meaningless, escaping is wasteful.

When a child's meticulously planned overseas itinerary gets appropriated for commercial use by an incompetent teacher.
When a young person first encounters an adult with authority to guide them but who is deeply problematic, agitation and anger are inevitable.

As a father, I encouraged him:
Organize your materials, run through scenarios, and courageously engage in dialogue with the teacher.
How will you articulate what you perceive as unfair?
Or will you develop a habit of withdrawal, euphemistically called "valuing harmony," when it's really just lacking the courage to face conflict?

### Conclusion: The Muscle of Resistance Requires Practice

Finally, the child mustered the courage to speak his true thoughts.
Although the force of expression was less than a third of what we practiced, it was still a good beginning.

The muscle of resistance, like running, requires practice.
Making your viewpoints clear so that when resistance is needed, you can be reasonable and justified.

As for those incompetent educators—what goes around, comes around.
