title: "The Truth About Homeschooling: A Parent's Insights and Gentle Resistance"
description: "Choosing homeschooling isn't seeking an academic shortcut, but rather a reflection on and philosophical choice regarding industrial civilization and capitalist life. Homeschooling is full of gray areas and uncertainty, severely testing parents' companionship and resolve—it absolutely cannot be approached with an 'outsourcing' mentality that shifts responsibility to institutions. When facing incompetent educators, parents must practice 'gentle and courteous resistance' together with their children, transforming setbacks and injustices into real learning nutrients, because without the courage for critique and resistance, one cannot grow in a turbulent world."

## The Truth About Homeschooling
### A Parent's Insights and Gentle Resistance

As a serial entrepreneur and father of children.
Being at the forefront of industry transformation, I deeply understand that education must adapt to accommodate environmental changes.

In 2015, we chose to let our children participate in non-school-based homeschooling.
These are my insights from several years of experience, for parents interested in homeschooling:

### Stripping Away the Romantic Labels of Homeschooling

1. **It's companionship, not outsourcing**: Parents need to invest substantial time. It's not about throwing money to "outsource" education to institutions or consultants.
2. **It's not an academic shortcut**: If you still believe in exam-oriented education, staying within the system is fine—lower communication costs, higher efficiency.
3. **It's co-entrepreneurship**: Homeschooling is a collaborative creative process with your child, where the curriculum is the product and the child is the user.
4. **Extremely high uncertainty**: Legal approval doesn't equal systematic perfection. Homeschooling is a system full of gray areas, testing students' character while challenging parents' nerves.

Choosing homeschooling reflects a deeper contemplation of industrial civilization and capitalist life.
It's a decision based on educational beliefs and philosophy, not merely methodology.
Whenever I see people proudly waving devaluing diplomas, boasting about getting into top universities, I always get a feeling of "Sir, I think you're in the wrong room."

### Gentle and Courteous Resistance

The true meaning of learning in daily life is: regardless of what situation you encounter, there's always an opportunity to transform it into learning nutrients.
Complaining is meaningless, avoiding is wasteful.

When a child's meticulously planned overseas trip is appropriated for commercial use by an incompetent teacher.
When a young person first encounters an adult with authority to guide them but who is deeply flawed, anger and agitation are inevitable.

As a father, I encouraged him:
Organize your materials, strategize, and courageously dialogue with the teacher.
How will you address what you feel is unfair?
Or will you develop a habit of withdrawal, euphemistically calling it "valuing harmony," when it's really just lacking the courage to face conflict?

### Conclusion: The Muscle of Resistance Needs Practice

Finally, the child mustered the courage to speak his true thoughts.
Although the force of expression was less than a third of what we practiced, it was still a good beginning.

The muscle of resistance, like running, needs practice.
Making your viewpoint clear so that when resistance is needed, you can be reasonable and justified.

As for those incompetent educators—what goes around, comes around.
