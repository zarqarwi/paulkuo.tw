title: "The Truth About Homeschooling: A Parent's Insights and Gentle Resistance"
description: "Choosing homeschool education is not about finding shortcuts to academic success, but rather a reflection on industrial civilization and capitalist life—a philosophical choice. Homeschooling is full of gray areas and uncertainty, severely testing parents' commitment and resilience. It absolutely cannot be approached with an 'outsourcing' mentality, pushing responsibility to institutions. When facing incompetent educators, parents must practice 'gentle and respectful resistance' together with their children, transforming setbacks and injustices into real learning nutrients, because without the courage to critique and resist, one cannot grow in a turbulent world."

## The Truth About Homeschooling
### A Parent's Insights and Gentle Resistance

As a serial entrepreneur and father of children.
Being at the forefront of industry transformation, I deeply understand that education must adapt to accommodate environmental changes.

In 2015, we chose to let our children participate in non-traditional homeschool education.
These are my insights from several years of experience, for parents interested in homeschooling:

### Stripping Away the Romantic Labels of Homeschooling

1. **It's accompaniment, not outsourcing**: Parents need to invest significant time. It's not about throwing money to "outsource" education to institutions or consultants.
2. **It's not an academic shortcut**: If you still worship academic credentialism, stay within the traditional system—lower communication costs, higher efficiency.
3. **It's co-entrepreneurship**: Homeschooling is a journey of co-creation with your children, where curriculum is the product and children are the users.
4. **Extremely high uncertainty**: Legal approval doesn't equal systematic perfection. Homeschooling is a system full of gray areas, testing students' character while challenging parents' hearts.

Choosing homeschooling reflects a deeper critique of industrial civilization and capitalist life.
It's a decision rooted in educational beliefs and philosophy, not merely methodology.
Whenever I see people proudly waving their depreciating diplomas, boasting about getting into top universities, I can't help but feel like "Sir, did you walk into the wrong room?"

### Gentle and Respectful Resistance

The true meaning of learning in daily life is: regardless of what situation you encounter, there's always an opportunity to transform it into learning nutrients.
Complaining is meaningless, escaping is wasteful.

When a child's meticulously planned overseas itinerary is appropriated for commercial use by an incompetent teacher.
When young people first encounter adults with authority over them who are deeply flawed, anger and agitation are inevitable.

As a father, I encourage him:
Organize your materials, conduct scenario planning, and courageously engage in dialogue with the teacher.
How will you articulate what you perceive as unfair?
Or will you develop a habit of withdrawal, euphemistically calling it "harmony above all," when it's really just lacking the courage to face conflict?

### Conclusion: The Muscle of Resistance Requires Practice

Finally, the child mustered the courage to express his genuine thoughts.
Although the force of expression was less than one-third of what we practiced, it was still a good beginning.

The muscle of resistance, like running, requires practice.
Making your viewpoint clear so that when resistance is needed, you can act reasonably and justifiably.

As for those incompetent educators, what goes around comes around.
