Apophatic theology reminds us: saying what God 'is not' gets closer to truth than proclaiming what God 'is.' In an age awash with certainty, this courage of negation is paradoxically a deeper form of faith."

# God Beyond Definition
## Why Theology Needs the Courage of Negation

Humanity has always wanted to define God. We say: God is omnipotent. God is omnibenevolent. God is eternal.

These statements sound solemn and certain. But can they truly capture God?

## The Arrogance of Language

Language is one of humanity's most powerful tools. But when facing Ultimate Reality, language often becomes the greatest obstacle.

When we say "God is omnipotent," we're actually using our human understanding of "power" to frame God. But is God's "omnipotence" really the same as what we imagine?

Apophatic Theology offers a different path: Rather than saying what God is, say what God is not.

## The Courage of Negation

Saying "God is not finite" is more honest than saying "God is infinite." Because the former acknowledges our language is limited, while the latter implies we already understand the infinite.

Apophatic theology is not skepticism. It is a deeper faith — faith deep enough to admit what we don't know.

## In an Age Awash with Certainty

Today's religious discourse is filled with certainty. Every denomination claims to possess truth. Every preacher claims to know God's will.

But apophatic theology reminds us: True reverence is silence before God. Not because there is nothing to say, but because we know — some things, once spoken, are already distorted.

## Conclusion

God transcends definition. This is not the end of faith. It is faith's true beginning.
