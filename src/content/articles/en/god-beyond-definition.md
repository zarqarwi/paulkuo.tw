description: "We're accustomed to defining God through language, but true theological wisdom lies in acknowledging the limitations of language. Apophatic theology reminds us: saying what God 'is not' brings us closer to truth than proclaiming what God 'is.' In an age flooded with certainty, this courage to negate is actually a deeper form of faith."

## God Beyond Definition
### Why Theology Needs the Courage to Negate

Humanity has always sought to define God.

We say: God is omnipotent.
We say: God is all-good.
We say: God is eternal.

These statements sound solemn, certain.
But do they truly capture God?

### The Arrogance of Language

Language is one of humanity's most powerful tools.
But when confronting Ultimate Reality,
language often becomes our greatest obstacle.

When we say "God is omnipotent,"
we're actually framing God through our human understanding of "power."

But is God's "omnipotence"
really what we imagine it to be?

Apophatic Theology offers a different path:
Rather than saying what God is, say what God is not.

### The Courage to Negate

Saying "God is not finite"
is more honest than saying "God is infinite."

Because the former acknowledges our linguistic limitations,
while the latter implies we've already comprehended the infinite.

Apophatic theology is not skepticism.
It is a deeper faith—
faith deep enough to admit we don't know.

---

### In an Age of Rampant Certainty

Contemporary religious discourse overflows with certainty.

Every denomination claims to possess the truth.
Every preacher claims to know God's mind.

But apophatic theology reminds us:
True reverence means falling silent before God.

Not because we have nothing to say,
but because we know—
some things, once spoken, are already distorted.

### Conclusion

God transcends definition.
This is not faith's endpoint.
This is where faith truly begins.
