## God Beyond Definition
### Why Theology Needs the Courage to Negate

Humanity has always sought to define God.

We say: God is omnipotent.
We say: God is all-good.
We say: God is eternal.

These statements sound solemn, certain.
But do they truly capture God?

### The Arrogance of Language

Language is one of humanity's most powerful tools.
But when facing Ultimate Reality,
language often becomes the greatest obstacle.

When we say "God is omnipotent,"
we are actually framing God with our human understanding of "power."

But is God's "omnipotence"
really what we imagine it to be?

Apophatic Theology offers a different path:
Rather than saying what God is, say what God is not.

### The Courage to Negate

To say "God is not finite"
is more honest than saying "God is infinite."

Because the former acknowledges our linguistic limitations,
while the latter implies we have already understood the infinite.

Apophatic theology is not skepticism.
It is a deeper faith—
faith deep enough to admit we don't know.

---

### In an Age Flooded with Certainty

Contemporary religious discourse is full of certainty.

Every denomination claims to possess the truth.
Every preacher claims to know God's will.

But apophatic theology reminds us:
True reverence is to be silent before God.

Not because we have nothing to say,
but because we know—
some things, once spoken, are already askew.

### Conclusion

God transcends definition.
This is not faith's endpoint.
This is faith's true beginning.
