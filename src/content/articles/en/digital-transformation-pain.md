title: "The Labor Pains of Digital Transformation: Why Do Digital Transformations Always End in Failure?"
description: "Digital transformation is a painful process akin to the labor pains of 'full dilation,' and most companies are pronounced dead before successful delivery. The vast gap between vision and reality lies in: the transformation of mindset is as fatal as changing an organization's blood, and senior talent with digital DNA and continuous learning capabilities is extremely scarce. More ruthlessly, existing power structures often view innovation as a threat to resource competition, secretly setting up layers of resistance. In this era of change, while not transforming quickly won't lead to immediate death, it will inevitably result in being invisibly eliminated."

## The Labor Pains of Full Dilation
### Why Do Digital Transformations Always End in Failure?

At the Growth Hacker conference, a slide about "Digital Transformation Stages" precisely hit the pain point of countless managers.

The transformation process is like full dilation in the delivery room:

- Stage 1: Feel the threat, desire progress.
- Stage 2: Appoint senior executives with digital DNA.
- Stage 3: Launch and assess the legacy burden of past systems.
- Stage 4: Organize requirements, understand APIs, enable the organization to connect with third parties, start operating like an internet company.
- Stage 5: Successfully build a self-developed Digital Experience Platform (DXP).

The reality is, in my past work experience, I've witnessed at least three companies die before reaching Stage 2.
If we compare transformation to childbirth, nothing counts as true success until full dilation is complete and the baby is born crying.

Everyone wants to progress, but why is there always such a vast gap between aspiration and practice?

### Three Fatal Wounds of Transformation

Through long observation, I've realized there are three core reasons why transformation gets stuck:

#### 1. Mindset Transformation Equals Blood Transfusion
Reading inspirational feel-good articles is entirely different from real combat in the marketplace.
Replacing Type A blood with Type B blood can be fatal.
Even more terrifying is that not transforming quickly won't cause a company to collapse immediately—the gradual loss of competitiveness is "imperceptible" to most people.

#### 2. The Ceiling of Learning Capability
Finding operational experts with digital DNA is as difficult as ascending to heaven.
They must understand both the industry and keep pace with the times, requiring a kind of "uninterrupted learning capability."
But traditional education misleads people into thinking that obtaining a diploma is the end of learning, and many people's brains seem to automatically stop functioning at a certain age.

#### 3. Assassination by Power Structures
The deployment of power and the level of knowledge are often extremely disproportionate.
Traditional departments that control advantageous resources are fundamentally unwilling to see innovative evolution.
Vested interests accustomed to being the boss will commonly trip up and backstab to prevent new business units from competing for resources—it's practically routine.

### Conclusion

The dilemma facing traditional companies is not limited to traditional industries.
Even Web 1.0 era internet companies, if they refuse to adjust and change, will likewise be abandoned by the times.

Environmental progress is ruthless and rapid.
I'm not sure if this is the most beautiful era.
But one thing is certain: this is absolutely an era of change and cruelty.
