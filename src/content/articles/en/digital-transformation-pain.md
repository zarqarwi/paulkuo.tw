title: "The Labor Pains of Full Dilation: Why Do Digital Transformations Always End in Failure?"
description: "Digital transformation is a painful process akin to the 'full dilation' of childbirth, and most enterprises declare defeat before successful delivery. The vast gap between vision and reality lies in: mindset transformation is as lethal as a complete organizational blood transfusion, and senior talent with digital DNA and continuous learning capabilities is extremely scarce. More brutally, existing power structures often view innovation as a threat to resource competition, covertly setting up layers of resistance. In this era of change, while not transforming quickly won't cause immediate death, it will inevitably lead to silent elimination."

# The Labor Pains of Full Dilation
## Why Do Digital Transformations Always End in Failure?

At a growth hacking conference, a slide about "digital transformation stages" struck a precise nerve with countless managers.

The transformation process is like full dilation in a delivery room:

- Stage 1: Sensing threats, hoping for progress.
- Stage 2: Appointing senior executives with digital DNA.
- Stage 3: Initiating and auditing legacy system baggage.
- Stage 4: Sorting requirements, understanding APIs, enabling organizational third-party connections, starting to operate like an internet company.
- Stage 5: Successfully building an in-house Digital Experience Platform (DXP).

Reality is, in my past work experience, I've witnessed at least three companies die before reaching Stage 2.
If we compare transformation to childbirth, nothing counts as true success until full dilation is complete and the baby cries.

Everyone wants progress, but why is there always such a vast gap between aspiration and implementation?

## Three Fatal Wounds of Transformation

Through extensive observation, I've identified three core reasons why transformations get stuck:

### 1. Mindset Transformation Equals Blood Transfusion
Reading inspirational chicken soup articles is entirely different from real combat in the marketplace.
Replacing Type A blood with Type B blood is lethal.
More terrifyingly, not transforming quickly doesn't cause immediate company collapse—the gradual loss of competitiveness is "imperceptible" to most people.

### 2. The Ceiling of Learning Capacity
Finding operational experts with digital DNA is like searching for needles in haystacks.
They must understand the industry while keeping pace with the times, requiring "uninterrupted learning power."
But traditional education misleads people into thinking diplomas mark the end of knowledge pursuit—many brains seem to automatically cease functioning at a certain age.

### 3. Assassination by Power Structures
The deployment of power and the altitude of knowledge are often extremely disproportionate.
Legacy units controlling advantageous resources have no interest in seeing innovative evolution.
Vested interests accustomed to being top dogs routinely trip up and backstab new business units to prevent resource dilution.

## Conclusion

The predicament facing traditional companies isn't limited to traditional industries.
Even Web 1.0 era internet companies will be abandoned by the times if they refuse to adjust and change.

Environmental progress is merciless and swift.
I'm uncertain whether this is the most beautiful era.
But I can be certain this is absolutely an era of change and cruelty.
