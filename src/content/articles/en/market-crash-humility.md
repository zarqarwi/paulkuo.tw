  On March 12, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted over 2,300 points in a single day, triggering circuit breakers across global markets. The spread of COVID-19 outpaced every predictive model, shattering investors' habitual tendency to extrapolate the future from historical experience. Drawing from Popper's falsifiability principle, combined with his own investment observations and entrepreneurial experience, Paul poses a fundamental question: facing true unknowns, what is the only thing we can do? The answer isn't more analysis—it's acknowledging the limits of what we know.

On March 12, 2020, the U.S. stock market triggered a circuit breaker within minutes of opening. The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed down over 2,300 points—a decline of nearly 10%. Within just ten days, circuit breakers were triggered four times—more violent than even the financial crisis twelve years prior. On the darkest day of 2008, the Dow fell 778 points. What fell in a single day now was three times that.

It all stemmed from COVID-19's global spread.

But the truly terrifying thing wasn't the magnitude of the decline itself. The truly terrifying thing was: nobody knew what would happen next.

## All the Models Failed

As someone who has long observed markets, I tried to do everything I "should" do in those days: analyze technical patterns, read central bank statements, cross-reference historical precedents. But every analytical framework I habitually relied on told me the same thing—"Your past experience doesn't apply here."

We're accustomed to inferring the unknown from the known. Seeing the stock market crash, the instinctive reaction is: "The market crashed in 2008 too, and it bounced back eventually." But 2008 didn't have global lockdowns. It didn't have cities of millions become ghost towns overnight. There weren't cruise ships becoming floating virus incubation chambers, or face masks becoming a matter of national strategic importance.

The tools we have—whether technical analysis or fundamental analysis—were all constructed in a "normal world." When the world's operating rules themselves change, these tools are like trying to stop a tsunami with a paper umbrella.

## Popper's Reminder

During that period, I revisited the work of philosopher of science Karl Popper.

Popper's most famous claim is: a theory counts as science only if it can be falsified. This doesn't mean "science is something that gets overturned," but rather—the value of science lies not in "proving what is right," but in "acknowledging what might be wrong." A good theory must preemptively specify the conditions under which it would be proven false. If a theory can never be wrong no matter what, it's not science at all—it's faith.

I find this approach particularly powerful when applied to investing and decision-making.

Most investors—myself included—spend too much time searching for evidence that "proves I'm right." We seek data supporting our views, listen to analysts who agree with us, and find comfort in echo chambers on social media. The essence of these behaviors is all about "verification," not "falsification."

But Popper tells us that genuine intellectual progress comes from falsification—from actively asking yourself: "Under what circumstances would my judgment be wrong?"

## The Power of "I Don't Know"

To be frank, in those days in March 2020, I did something that very few investors in that circle would openly admit: I told myself—I genuinely don't understand what's coming.

Not false modesty, but a real acknowledgment that I didn't know what would happen next.

I didn't know how long it would take to develop a vaccine (the most optimistic predictions at the time were 18 months; most experts thought it impossible). I didn't know how long lockdowns would last. I didn't know whether the central banks' massive quantitative easing would trigger inflation. I didn't know whether global supply chains would break.

Each "I don't know" made me more lucid.

Because the trap of "I know" is that—it makes you act prematurely. You make potentially ruinous decisions based on incomplete information before you've truly understood the situation. While the power of "I don't know" is that—it makes you wait. Wait for more signals, wait for a clearer picture to emerge.

In running SDTI, I learned similar lessons. Every day of entrepreneurship is filled with uncertainty, and the most dangerous decisions I've witnessed don't usually come from "not knowing what to do," but from "thinking you know." Decisions made with overconfidence, decisions that didn't leave an escape route—those are truly fatal.

## Reality Is Always Crueler Than Models

What happened to the market that week?

On March 16, the Dow fell nearly 3,000 more points, setting a new record for the largest single-day decline in history. Then, in the months that followed, even as nearly every analyst predicted further decline, the U.S. stock market embarked on a remarkable V-shaped recovery. By summer, many people began saying "I always knew it would bounce back."

But let's be honest: nobody "knew" that in March. Those who later claimed they saw the bottom aren't sharing insight—they're rewriting memory.

How would Popper see this? He'd probably say: "The fact that the market bounced back doesn't mean your judgment at that time was correct. It just means that this time, you happened not to be falsified."

Reality is always more complex and cruel than our models. What we can grasp is always only one facet of reality. This isn't pessimism—it's epistemic clarity. And in [an age when even market analysis is being overturned by falsification](/articles/falsification-market-crisis), when an information torrent makes us think we can analyze and predict everything, this clarity becomes more precious.

## A Historic Day

March 13, 2020. If we look back from the future, what this day will be remembered for is not the magnitude of the decline, but a fact it revealed: all our cognitive frameworks are fragile in the face of true "unknown unknowns."

After that, I became much more skeptical of the word "certainty." Not to avoid making judgments, but to leave a question mark after each one.

If Popper taught us anything, it's this: the best knowledge isn't knowledge of "what I know," but knowledge of "what I know I don't know." And [in an age when even AI hallucinates](/articles/canary-in-coal-mine-ai-employment), admitting your ignorance might be the most lucid stance you can take.
