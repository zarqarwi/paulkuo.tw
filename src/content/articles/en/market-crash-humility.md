title: "Revelations from a Market Crash: Knowing You 'Don't Know' Is the Bottom Line of Survival"
description: "Facing the Dow's plunge of 2,000 points and unprecedented global lockdowns, humanity's existing experience can no longer provide effective guidance. Philosopher Karl Popper's 'falsifiability' reminds us: in a world of extreme volatility, admitting we 'don't understand' offers far more protection than blindly applying old models. The cruelty of the real world often exceeds the boundaries of our imagination. Only by recognizing the limits of our cognition and maintaining high vigilance can we avoid being devoured by the market when black swans arrive."

## Revelations from a Market Crash
### Knowing You "Don't Know" Is the Bottom Line of Survival

U.S. markets opened with a violent plunge, trading halted.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed by 2,000 points—even the financial tsunami of a decade ago wasn't this intense.

All of this, stemming from the global spread of COVID-19.

### The Failure of Experience

We're accustomed to using the known to probe the unknown.
Using past experience to judge future events. This is the natural way the human brain operates.

But in this volatile world,
too many events have exceeded our understanding and imagination.

- Lockdowns of modern cities with populations in the tens of millions.
- Cruise ships transformed into floating viral incubators.
- Face masks becoming strategic resources subject to national export bans.

These are all things we've never encountered before.

### Embracing the Wisdom of "I Don't Know"

Philosopher Karl Popper said:
"If a theory can be falsifiable, it is science."

This is the method of using falsification to probe knowledge.

In moments like these,
knowing you "don't understand" is more important than pretending to "see clearly."

I truly cannot comprehend this situation!
But precisely because I know "I don't know what's happening," this actually makes me more vigilant.

### Conclusion

Don't underestimate the complexity of the world.
Reality is always more treacherous than what we can detect.

This is a historic day.
The old cognition can never return.
