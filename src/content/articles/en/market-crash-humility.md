title: "Revelations from the Crash: Knowing You 'Don't Know' Is the Bottom Line of Survival"
description: "Facing a 2,000-point plunge in the Dow and unprecedented global lockdowns, humanity's existing experience can no longer provide effective guidance. Philosopher Karl Popper's 'falsificationism' reminds us: in an extremely volatile world, admitting we 'can't see clearly' offers far more protection than blindly applying old models. The cruelty of the real world often exceeds the boundaries of our imagination. Only by recognizing the limits of our own cognition and maintaining high vigilance can we avoid being devoured by the market when black swans arrive."

## Revelations from the Crash
### Knowing You "Don't Know" Is the Bottom Line of Survival

U.S. markets opened with a plunge, trading suspended.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed by 2,000 points—not even the financial tsunami of ten years ago was this intense.

All of it stemming from the global spread of COVID-19.

### The Failure of Experience

We habitually use the known to probe the unknown.
Using past experience to judge future events. This is the natural operation of the human brain.

But in this changing world,
too many events have already exceeded our understanding and imagination.

- Modern cities with populations of tens of millions under lockdown.
- Cruise ships transformed into floating viral petri dishes.
- Face masks becoming strategic materials subject to national export bans.

These are all things we've never encountered before.

### Embracing the Wisdom of "I Don't Know"

Philosopher Karl Popper said:
"If a theory can be falsified, then it is scientific."

This is the way of probing knowledge through falsification.

In moments like these,
knowing that you "don't understand" is more important than pretending to "see clearly."

I truly cannot make sense of this situation!
But precisely because I know "I don't know what's happening," this actually makes me more vigilant.

### Conclusion

Don't underestimate the complexity of the world.
Reality is always more treacherous than what we can detect.

This is a historic day.
Old ways of knowing can never return.
