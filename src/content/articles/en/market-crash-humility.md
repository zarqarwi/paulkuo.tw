description: "Facing a 2,000-point plunge in the Dow and unprecedented global lockdowns, human experience can no longer provide reliable guidance. Karl Popper's falsificationism reminds us: in a world of extreme volatility, admitting you 'don't understand' is far more protective than blindly applying old models."

## Lessons from the Crash
### Knowing What You Don't Know Is the Bottom Line of Survival

U.S. markets opened with a plunge. Trading was halted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed by two thousand points—more violent than even the financial crisis a decade earlier.

It all stemmed from the global spread of COVID-19.

### When Experience Fails

We habitually use the known to probe the unknown—using past experience to judge future events. This is the natural operating mode of the human brain.

But in this volatile world, too many events have already exceeded our comprehension and imagination. Modern cities of ten million people under lockdown. Cruise ships turned into floating virus incubators. Face masks becoming nationally embargoed strategic resources.

None of these had ever happened before.

### The Wisdom of Embracing "I Don't Know"

Philosopher Karl Popper said: "If a theory can be falsified, it is science."

This is the method of probing knowledge through falsification.

In moments like these, knowing that you "don't understand" is far more important than pretending you do.

I genuinely cannot read this situation. But precisely because I know "I don't know what's happening," I remain all the more vigilant.

### Conclusion

Never underestimate the complexity of the world. Reality is always more treacherous than what we can detect.

This is a day for the history books. The old frameworks of understanding are gone and won't come back.
