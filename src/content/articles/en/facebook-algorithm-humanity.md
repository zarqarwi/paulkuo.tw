title: "Technology Begins with Human Nature: Business Insights from Facebook's Algorithm Reconstruction"
description: "Facebook's algorithm adjustment shifts interaction focus from business fan pages back to interpersonal communication, causing widespread lament in marketing circles. But this is actually a platform's courageous self-correction toward greatness: refusing to let users become mere consumers of meaningless content, and deeply applying AI to guide more meaningful social behavior. When traffic dividends disappear, brands must possess the ability to humanize themselves and generate genuine dialogue—an 'incarnational' capacity, because the essence of business is ultimately the exchange of value, not mere product exposure."

## Technology Begins with Human Nature
### Business Insights from Facebook's Algorithm Reconstruction

When Mark Zuckerberg announced the adjustment to algorithmic logic,
the marketing world's atmosphere was one of widespread lament.

But I still believe Facebook is a great company.
This adjustment represents a tech platform's courageous self-evolution.

### Refusing Attention Hijacking

Mark's words, translated into plain language, mean:
"People are spending too much time on Facebook. In the past, we aimed to make people stick around, but this isn't good for society. In the future, we want to return time to meaningful things."

This blurs the boundary between for-profit enterprises and non-profit organizations.
Facebook has evolved from simply measuring "stickiness" to pursuing "quality of engagement."

Through advances in facial recognition and semantic analysis, we can infer that Facebook has long been deeply applying AI to our online social behavior, attempting to define "what constitutes meaningful activity."

### Consumers Are First and Foremost "People"

Marketers often forget one thing:
Consumers are not equivalent to complete human beings.

In people's time allocation, consumer behavior occupies only an extremely small portion.
We do indeed care about eating, drinking, and purchasing, but if news feeds are flooded with endless sales pitches, it only breeds annoyance.

The essence of Connection includes, beyond product exchange:
- Dialogue of ideas
- Exchange of emotions  
- Transmission of compassion and goodness

These elements are the nutrients that allow us, as "information containers," to live with greater quality. Even if platforms don't block ads, users will manually reduce the frequency of these disruptive messages.

### The Survival Battle of Brand Humanization

The algorithm adjustment is a positive development for ordinary people, reducing interference.
But for traditional e-commerce, it's a brutal survival battle.

If you can't build brand power, you're doomed.
- Stop fantasizing that traffic dividends or tech tactics can increase reach
- The relative cost of traditional ad placement will become prohibitively expensive

Future business requires "incarnational" capabilities.
You must humanize your brand, transforming it into an entity capable of dialogue and value exchange. One interesting piece of witty content might generate more traffic than a professional marketing team spinning their wheels for a week.

### Conclusion

Products are limited, but value exchange is limitless.
Break free from traditional business logic, because operating e-commerce is, after all, just one small piece of managing life.
