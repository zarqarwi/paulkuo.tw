title: "Technology Begins with Humanity: Business Insights from Facebook's Algorithm Reconstruction"
description: "Facebook's algorithm adjustment shifts the focus of interaction from business fan pages back to interpersonal communication, causing widespread dismay in marketing circles. But this is actually a great platform's self-correction: refusing to let users become consumables for meaningless content, and deeply applying AI to guide more meaningful social behavior. When traffic dividends disappear, brands must possess the ability to anthropomorphize themselves and generate real dialogue—the 'incarnation' capability—because the essence of business is ultimately the exchange of value, not mere product exposure."

## Technology Begins with Humanity
### Business Insights from Facebook's Algorithm Reconstruction

When Mark Zuckerberg announced the adjustment to algorithmic logic,
the marketing world was filled with laments.

But I still believe Facebook is a great company.
This adjustment represents a courageous self-evolution of the tech platform.

### Rejecting Attention Hijacking

Mark's words, translated into plain language, mean:
"People are spending too much time on Facebook. In the past, we aimed to make people stick around, but this isn't good for society. In the future, we want to return time to meaningful things."

This blurs the boundary between for-profit enterprises and non-profit organizations.
Facebook has evolved from simply measuring "stickiness" to pursuing "quality of stickiness."

Through advances in facial recognition and semantic analysis, we can infer that Facebook has long been deeply applying AI to our online social behaviors, attempting to define "what constitutes meaningful activity."

### Consumers Are First and Foremost "People"

Marketers often forget one thing:
Consumers are not equivalent to complete human beings.

In people's time allocation, consumer behavior occupies only a tiny portion.
We do care about eating, drinking, and buying, but if news feeds are flooded with endless sales pitches, it only breeds annoyance.

The essence of Connection, beyond commodity exchange, also includes:
- Dialogue of ideas
- Exchange of emotions
- Transmission of love and goodness

These elements are the nutrients that allow us, as "information containers," to live with greater quality. Even if platforms don't block ads, users will manually reduce the frequency of these disruptive messages.

### The Survival Battle of Brand Anthropomorphization

The algorithm adjustment is a positive for ordinary people, reducing interference.
But for traditional e-commerce, it's a brutal survival battle.

If you can't create brand power, you're doomed.
- Stop fantasizing that traffic dividends or technical means can increase reach
- The relative cost of traditional advertising will become prohibitively expensive

Future business requires "incarnation" capabilities.
You must anthropomorphize your brand, turning it into an entity that can dialogue and exchange value. A single witty quip might generate more traffic than a professional marketing team's week of frantic activity.

### Conclusion

Products are limited, but value exchange is limitless.
Break free from traditional business logic, because running e-commerce is, after all, just one small piece of managing life.
