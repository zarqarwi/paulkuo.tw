title: "Technology Begins with Human Nature: Business Insights from Facebook's Algorithm Reconstruction"
description: "Facebook's algorithm adjustment shifts interaction focus from business fan pages back to interpersonal communication, causing widespread lament in marketing circles. However, this is actually a platform's courageous self-correction toward greatness: refusing to let users become consumers of meaningless content, and deeply applying AI to guide more meaningful social behavior. When traffic dividends disappear, brands must possess the ability to humanize themselves and generate authentic dialogue—an 'incarnation system' capability—because the essence of business is ultimately the exchange of value, not mere product exposure."

# Technology Begins with Human Nature
## Business Insights from Facebook's Algorithm Reconstruction

When Mark Zuckerberg announced the adjustment to algorithmic logic,
the marketing world's atmosphere was one of widespread lament.

But I still believe that Facebook is a great company.
This adjustment is a tech platform's courageous self-evolution.

## Rejecting Attention Hijacking

Mark's words, translated into plain language, are:
"People are spending too much time on Facebook. In the past, we aimed to make people stick around, but this isn't good for society. In the future, we want to return time to meaningful things."

This blurs the boundary between for-profit enterprises and non-profit organizations.
Facebook has evolved from simply measuring "stickiness" to pursuing "quality of stickiness."

Through advances in facial recognition and semantic analysis, we can infer that Facebook has long been deeply applying AI to our online social behaviors, attempting to define "what constitutes meaningful things."

## Consumers Are First and Foremost "People"

Marketers often forget one thing:
consumers do not equal complete human beings.

In people's time allocation, consumer behavior occupies only a tiny portion.
We do indeed care about eating, drinking, buying, and selling, but if news feeds are flooded with endless sales pitches, it only breeds annoyance.

The essence of Connection includes, beyond commodity exchange:
- Dialogue of ideas
- Exchange of emotions
- Transmission of love and goodness

These elements are the nutrients that allow us, as "information containers," to live with higher quality. Even if platforms don't block ads, users will manually reduce the frequency of these disruptive messages.

## The Survival War of Brand Humanization

The algorithmic adjustment is a positive development for ordinary people, reducing interference.
But for traditional e-commerce, it's a brutal survival war.

If you can't build brand power, you're doomed.
- Stop fantasizing that traffic dividends or technical means can increase reach
- The relative cost of traditional advertising will become prohibitively expensive

Future business requires "incarnation system" capabilities.
You must humanize your brand, transforming it into an entity that can dialogue and exchange value. One interesting piece of witty commentary might generate more traffic than a professional marketing team's week of frantic activity.

## Conclusion

Products are limited, but value exchange is unlimited.
Break out of traditional business logic, because operating e-commerce is ultimately just one small piece of managing life.
