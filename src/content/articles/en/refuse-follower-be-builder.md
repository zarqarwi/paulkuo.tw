title: "Refuse to Be a Noisy Follower: The Survival Choices of Five Industry Roles"
description: "Industry ecosystems consist of builders, traders, investors, commentators, and followers. Media (commentators) often only care about traffic, traders only care about volatility; blindly following their emotions leads to loss of judgment. Young people should choose to become 'builders' who get their hands dirty, refuse to define success through consumerism and money, and create the future through sustainable and quality actions."

## Refuse to Be a Noisy Follower
### The Survival Choices of Five Industry Roles

Regardless of which industry you're in, the people within can roughly be divided into five categories.
For those just entering society, ask yourself: what kind of person do you want to become?

1. **Builder**: Blazes trails and creates systems. Usually entrepreneurs and those responsible for operations.
2. **Trader**: Views opportunities as commodities for short-term trading, unconcerned with long-term value.
3. **Investor**: Uses capital to amplify industry progress, with long investment cycles, not speculating on short-term gains.
4. **Commentator**: Provides information and promotes civilized dialogue. However, most have devolved into media personalities who merely follow trends.
5. **Follower**: Lacks independent judgment, follows traders in short-term moves. After ten years of work, they've simply repeated the same day ten thousand times.

### See Through the Illusions of Traffic and Volatility

The world is "built," not merely sustained.

If you're always dancing to the emotions of commentators (media), your days won't get better.
Media's profit model is traffic. For them, truth doesn't matter—what they need as fuel is their audience's "panic" and "euphoria."

Traders are the same. They only care about volatility, and when shorting, they can't wait for doomsday to arrive.
Understanding each role's internal agenda prevents us from being easily brainwashed.

### Choose to Become a Builder

For young people, my only advice is:
Learn to be a Builder.

Get your hands dirty. Go create.
It doesn't matter if you pick the wrong industry—any genuine involvement will teach you real skills.
If you're always watching from the sidelines, you'll ultimately only learn to "talk the talk."

### Conclusion: Define Your 21st Century

How you create now determines how you'll live in the future.

We can continue using last century's consumerism, defining our identity through endless purchasing, converting all achievements into dollar signs.
Then watch helplessly as climate spirals out of control and the world descends into madness.

Or we choose a different life philosophy.
Pursuing a simple, restrained yet quality-rich sustainable lifestyle. Temperament and taste have never needed to be built with money.

Don't let 22nd-century humans hate us.
That is, assuming human civilization makes it to the 22nd century.
