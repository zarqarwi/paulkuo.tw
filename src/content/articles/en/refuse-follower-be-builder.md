title: "Refuse to Be a Noisy Follower: Survival Choices Among the Five Industry Roles"
description: "Industrial ecosystems consist of builders, traders, investors, commentators, and followers. Media (commentators) often only care about traffic, traders only care about volatility; blindly following their emotions will lead to loss of judgment. Young people should choose to become 'builders' who get their hands dirty, refuse to define success through consumerism and money, and create the future through sustainable and meaningful actions."

## Refuse to Be a Noisy Follower
### Survival Choices Among the Five Industry Roles

Regardless of which industry you're in, the people within it can roughly be divided into five categories.
As someone just entering society, ask yourself: what kind of person do you want to be?

1. **Builder**: Blazing trails and creating systems. Usually entrepreneurs and those responsible for operations.
2. **Trader**: Views opportunities as commodities for short-term buying and selling, unconcerned with long-term value.
3. **Investor**: Amplifies industry progress through capital investment, with long investment cycles, not speculation.
4. **Commentator**: Provides information and promotes civilized dialogue. However, most have devolved into media personalities who merely follow the wind.
5. **Follower**: Lacks independent thinking, follows traders in and out of positions. After ten years of work, they've simply repeated the same day ten thousand times.

### Seeing Through the Illusions of Traffic and Volatility

The world is "built," not merely sustained.

If you're always dancing to the emotional tune of commentators (media), your days won't get better.
Media's profit model is traffic. For them, truth doesn't matter—what they need as fuel is the audience's "panic" and "euphoria."

Traders are the same. They only care about volatility; when shorting, they can't wait for the apocalypse to arrive.
Understanding each role's internal agenda helps us avoid being easily brainwashed.

### Choose to Be a Builder

For young people, my only advice is:
Learn to be a Builder.

Get your hands dirty. Go create.
It doesn't matter if you pick the wrong industry—any investment will develop real skills.
If you're always watching from the sidelines, you'll ultimately only learn to "talk the talk."

### Conclusion: Define Your 21st Century

How you create now determines how you'll live in the future.

We can continue using last century's consumerism, defining our identity through endless purchasing, converting all achievements into dollar signs.
Then watch helplessly as climate spins out of control and the world descends into madness.

Or we can choose a different philosophy of life.
Pursue simple, restrained yet quality-rich sustainable living. Temperament and taste never need to be built with banknotes.

Don't let 22nd-century humans hate us.
That is, assuming human civilization even makes it to the 22nd century.
