title: "Refuse to Be a Noisy Follower: Survival Choices Among the Five Industry Roles"
description: "Industry ecosystems consist of builders, traders, investors, commentators, and followers. Media (commentators) often only care about traffic, while traders only care about volatility; blindly following their emotions will lead to loss of judgment. Young people should choose to become 'builders' who dirty their hands, refuse to define success through consumerism and money, and create the future through sustainable and meaningful actions."

## Refuse to Be a Noisy Follower
### Survival Choices Among the Five Industry Roles

Regardless of which industry you're in, the people within it can roughly be divided into five categories.
As you enter society, ask yourself: what kind of person do you want to be?

1. **Builder**: Blazes trails and creates systems. Usually entrepreneurs and those responsible for operations.
2. **Trader**: Views opportunities as commodities for short-term buying and selling, unconcerned with long-term value.
3. **Investor**: Uses capital investment to amplify industry progress, with long investment cycles, avoiding short-term speculation.
4. **Commentator**: Provides information and promotes civilized dialogue. However, most have devolved into media personalities who merely follow trends.
5. **Follower**: Lacks independent judgment, follows traders in short-term movements. After ten years of work, they've simply repeated the same day ten thousand times.

### Seeing Through the Illusions of Traffic and Volatility

The world is "built," not merely sustained.

If you're always dancing to the emotions of commentators (media), your days won't get better.
Media's profit model is traffic. To them, truth doesn't matter—audience "panic" and "euphoria" are the fuel they need.

Traders are the same. They only care about volatility; when shorting, they can't wait for doomsday to arrive.
Understanding each role's inner agenda prevents us from being easily brainwashed.

### Choose to Become a Builder

For young people, my only advice is:
Learn to be a Builder.

Get your hands dirty. Go create.
It doesn't matter if you pick the wrong industry—any investment will develop real skills.
If you're always watching from the sidelines, you'll ultimately only learn to "talk the talk."

### Conclusion: Define Your 21st Century

How you create now determines how you'll live in the future.

We can continue using last century's consumerism, defining our identity through endless purchasing, converting all achievements into dollar signs.
Then watch helplessly as climate spirals out of control and the world descends into madness.

Or we choose a different life philosophy.
Pursuing simple, restrained yet quality-rich sustainable living. Temperament and taste have never needed to be built with banknotes.

Don't let 22nd-century humans hate us.
That is, assuming human civilization makes it to the 22nd century.
