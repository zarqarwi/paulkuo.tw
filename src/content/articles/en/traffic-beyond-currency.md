title: "Traffic Is More Than Currency: Social Role and Responsibility Behind Influence"
description: "Society blindly pursues 'traffic monetization,' yet ignores that traffic is essentially the manifestation of 'trust relationships.' When non-profit leaders commercialize traffic for profit, it leads to personal brand collapse. True influence is a tool for transmitting civilization, refusing to be held captive by singular capitalist logic."

# Traffic Is More Than Currency
## Social Role and Responsibility Behind Influence

The world doesn't lack products—it lacks attention. But traffic has more than just monetary expression; it is influence that transmits knowledge and advances civilization.
Traffic is the quantification of trust relationships.

Who you are determines how you should use traffic. If opinion leaders greedily monetize, the consequence is self-sabotage.
Profound convictions require settling time. Don't let influence deteriorate into numbers that merely reek of money.
