title: "Traffic is More Than Currency: Social Roles and Responsibilities Behind Influence"
description: "Today's society blindly pursues 'traffic monetization,' reducing human influence to mere commercial currency conversion, while overlooking that traffic is essentially the manifestation of 'trust relationships.' Traffic generation is closely tied to one's social persona. When a non-profit leader or knowledge disseminator forcibly commercializes their traffic for profit, it often leads to persona collapse and trust bankruptcy. True influence should be a tool for transmitting civilization and values, refusing to be hijacked by singular capitalist logic to maintain profound and lasting social impact."

## Traffic is More Than Currency
### Social Roles and Responsibilities Behind Influence

A friend asked me: "Why is everyone talking about traffic monetization?"

My response: Because the world doesn't lack products—it lacks attention.
But if you only think about monetization, you usually can't monetize.

### Traffic is the Quantification of Trust

Traffic has more than just monetary expression.

It is the influence that transmits knowledge, shares information, and promotes civilizational progress.

- The Ministry of Health and Welfare's live streams are for public communication.
- Greenpeace's videos are for transmitting values.
- Teachers' unpaid instruction is for educational reform.

None of this traffic is monetized, yet it is key to maintaining civilization.

From another perspective, traffic is "the quantification of trust relationships."
If the president started live-streaming to sell cat litter, even with amazing sales, we'd feel a profound sense of incongruity.

Because influence doesn't mean everything can or should be converted to cash.

### The Disaster of Role Displacement

Who you are determines your traffic.
Your persona determines how you should use that traffic.

If you're a key opinion leader (KOL), your voice comes from your non-profit social standing.
Once you become greedy and forcibly fit your influence into commercial logic for monetization,
the consequence is self-sabotage, severely damaging your credibility.

Wanting everything often results in becoming a four-faced bat:
telling mammals you're a mammal, telling birds you're a bird.

### Conclusion: Refusing the Clamor of Conformity

Having "traffic monetization" constantly on your lips is a manifestation of humanity's herd mentality.
Like primitive people chattering in tribes, lacking independent thought.

Profound conviction requires settling.
It comes from the solitary wilderness, neither competing nor clamoring.

Don't let your influence degrade into cheap numbers that only reek of money.
