title: "Traffic Is More Than Currency: Social Roles and Responsibilities Behind Influence"
description: "Today's society blindly pursues 'traffic monetization,' reducing human influence to mere commercial currency conversion, while ignoring that traffic is fundamentally the embodiment of 'trust relationships.' Traffic generation is intimately connected to one's social persona. When nonprofit leaders or knowledge disseminators forcibly commercialize their traffic for profit, it often leads to persona collapse and trust bankruptcy. True influence should serve as a tool for transmitting civilization and values, refusing to be bound by singular capitalist logic to maintain profound and lasting social impact."

## Traffic Is More Than Currency
### Social Roles and Responsibilities Behind Influence

A friend asked me: "Why is everyone talking about traffic monetization?"

My answer: Because the world doesn't lack products—it lacks attention.
But if you only think about monetization, you usually can't monetize.

### Traffic Is the Quantification of Trust

Traffic isn't just about monetary performance.

It's the influence that transmits knowledge, shares information, and promotes civilizational progress.

- Ministry of Health and Welfare livestreams are for public communication.
- Greenpeace videos are for transmitting values.
- Teachers' unpaid instruction is for educational reform.

None of this traffic gets monetized, yet it's crucial for sustaining civilization.

From another perspective, traffic is "the quantification of trust relationships."
If the president started livestreaming to sell cat litter, even with amazing sales, we'd feel a profound sense of incongruity.

Because influence doesn't equal that it can, or should, all become cash.

### The Disaster of Role Misalignment

Who you are determines your traffic.
Your persona determines how you should use that traffic.

If you're a key opinion leader (KOL), your voice comes from your nonprofit social standing.
Once you become greedy and forcibly fit your influence into commercial logic for monetization,
the consequence is self-sabotage, greatly damaging your credibility.

Wanting everything often turns you into a bat that belongs nowhere:
telling mammals you're a mammal, telling birds you're a bird.

### Conclusion: Refusing the Crowd's Clamor

Having "traffic monetization" constantly on your lips is a manifestation of humanity's herd mentality genes.
Like primitive people chattering away in tribes, lacking independent thinking.

Profound convictions require settling.
They come from the solitary wilderness, neither competing nor clamoring.

Don't let your influence degrade into cheap numbers that reek only of money.
