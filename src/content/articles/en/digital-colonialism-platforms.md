## Awakening from Digital Colonialism
### Rebuilding Survival Rules on Free Platforms

When Facebook once again announced algorithm adjustments,
many people jumped up in protest:

"Facebook has betrayed its original mission!"
"This is platform tyranny!"
"This company is finished!"

But don't you find this a bit strange?

### Free Chicken Legs and the Tower of Babel

We've used Facebook for ten years.
As end users, we haven't paid the platform a single penny.

In this massive system with 2 billion people, we enjoy the first network-scale experience in human history.
This is a modern Tower of Babel.
We check in, upload photos, and contact clients anytime, anywhere, with virtually no delay.

Behind this lies the platform's enormous capital investment and high-level talent.
Countless dollar signs are floating above it all.

We're like guests invited into a grand estate,
eating the free chicken legs our host provides every day.

One day, the host says they're changing the game rules.
What right do we have to protest?

### Acknowledging the Reality of Digital Colonialism

In the past, we too hoped that local software could become global platforms.
But falling behind is falling behind—this is reality.

Acknowledging that we are "digital colonies" is not shameful at all.

Understanding our actual situation helps us know how to move forward.
Those calls to "break free from Facebook's stranglehold"—take them with a grain of salt.
Jump to Instagram, and it's still Facebook's; build your own website, and you're still constrained by Google's algorithms.

### Conclusion: Misfortune and Fortune Intertwined

In misfortune lies hidden fortune.
Behind every bearish development lies bullish opportunity for certain emerging individuals or industries.

It's worth observing:
After algorithm adjustments, which industries cry the most pitifully and tragically?

Perhaps new opportunities are beckoning to us from that very direction.
