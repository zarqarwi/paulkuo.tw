title: "The Clarity of Digital Colonialism: When Free Platforms Change the Rules, What Can You Do?"
subtitle: "We enjoyed free benefits for ten years, and now the owner wants to change the menu—what right do you have to protest?"
description: "Facebook's algorithmic adjustments provoked widespread outcry, but the real issue isn't that the algorithm changed. It's that we never paid a single cent for this platform. When your business depends on infrastructure someone else provides for free, you are a digital colony. Acknowledging this reality isn't defeat—it's the starting point for reclaiming your destiny."

  In early 2018, Facebook announced a significant reduction in organic reach for Pages. Countless brands and content creators rushed to protest the "platform monopoly." But Paul, from an entrepreneur's perspective, saw a deeper problem: we built an entire business model on a platform we didn't own, didn't control, and didn't pay for, then felt angry when the rules changed—this isn't about monopoly power, it's about ourselves. This article approaches the problem through the lens of "digital colonialism," examining the nature of platform dependency and what those with clarity of mind should do when the rules change.

In January 2018, Facebook announced adjustments to its news feed algorithm, significantly reducing organic reach for Pages. The announcement set Taiwan's marketing and creator communities ablaze.

"Facebook betrayed us!"
"This is platform monopoly!"
"Ten years of work destroyed in an instant!"

I looked at these angry posts and thought: what exactly are you angry about?

## The Logic of Free Perks

Let me do the math.

Over the past decade, we—as users, creators, brand managers—accomplished so much on Facebook. Built Pages, posted content, ran ads, managed communities, communicated with customers through Messenger. In this massive system of over 2 billion users, we enjoyed humanity's first network effects at internet scale.

And as end users, how much money did we pay Facebook?

Zero.

Zero dollars. Ten years.

It's like being invited to a grand mansion for dinner and eating free chicken legs for ten years. One day the owner says: "I'm going to rearrange the seating and change the menu." You jump up and curse the owner for betraying you—is that fair?

It's not. But that's how most people reacted.

## You're Not a Customer, You're the Product

The crueler fact is: you're not even a "customer."

In the free platform's business model, you're not the client—advertisers are. You are the product. Your attention, your behavioral data, your social graph—these are what Facebook sells to advertisers.

So when Facebook adjusts its algorithm, it's not "betraying" you. It's optimizing its core product—the allocation of user attention—to better serve its real customers—advertisers.

This logic was there from day one. Ten years of free lunch just made most people forget.

## Digital Colonialism Is Not a Metaphor

I later used a term to describe this state: digital colonialism.

This is not a hyperbolic metaphor. Think about the definition of colonialism: your productive activity happens on land someone else owns, your resources are allocated by someone else, your rules are set by someone else. And—this is the critical part—you have no bargaining power over any of it.

What's the structural difference between a content creator putting everything on Facebook and a farmer farming in a colony?

The crops the farmer grows are distributed by the colonial government. The content you post is distributed by the algorithm. The farmer can't decide the tax rate. You can't decide the reach rate. If the farmer protests, the colonial government suppresses them. If you protest—well, the algorithm won't listen.

Admitting you're in digital colonialism is nothing to be ashamed of. What's truly shameful is enjoying free service for ten years, then acting betrayed when the rules change.

## Inescapable Dependency

Some say: "Then we'll just leave Facebook!"

Fine, leave. But where to?

Switch to Instagram? That's also Facebook (now Meta).
Move to YouTube? That's Google's, and it adjusts algorithms the same way.
Build your own website? Your traffic is still controlled by Google's search algorithm.
Pivot to Line@? The platform changes whenever it wants.

This is the dilemma of digital colonialism: you can switch to another colonial master, but you can't escape the colonial structure itself. Because in today's internet ecosystem, all traffic allocation authority rests in the hands of a few giant platforms.

During my time running SDTI, I deeply experienced this reality. We manage communities for clients, do content marketing, run ad campaigns. Every strategy's foundation is built on the platform's rules. And these rules can suddenly change when you're completely unprepared.

Once, we carefully crafted a month-long Facebook content strategy for a client. Two weeks after launch, an algorithm adjustment hit—organic reach dropped 40%. The client asked me: "Is there a problem with your strategy?" I said: "The strategy didn't change. The floor beneath us did."

## What to Do After Waking Up

So what do you do? Give up?

No. You replan with clarity.

First, build your own assets. Email lists, your own website, official LINE accounts—these are direct channels to your audience, [not controlled by any single platform's algorithm](/articles/algorithm-as-judge). They grow slowly, but they're yours.

Second, diversify your risk. Don't put all your eggs in one platform. If 80% of your traffic comes from Facebook, you've put 80% of your fate in a variable you can't control.

Third, observe opportunities in rule changes. Niebuhr had a useful saying: fortune and misfortune are intertwined. Every algorithm adjustment causes some to fall and others to rise. Those who calmly analyze the new rules while everyone else is crying usually find new openings.

## Misfortune and Fortune Intertwined

Back to that 2018 algorithm adjustment.

Who cried the loudest? Brands and creators who'd lived on free organic reach for years. They never built paid strategies, never developed traffic sources outside the platform. When the algorithm changed, they were caught naked.

At the same time, another group started seriously developing podcasts, newsletters, and proprietary communities. These channels don't have Facebook's scale, but they have something Facebook can never give you: [you have the final say](/articles/traffic-beyond-currency).

The reality of digital colonialism won't change. But your position within the colonial structure can.

The key isn't leaving the platform—that's unrealistic. The key is whether you're building something truly yours outside the platform.

Farming on someone else's land is fine. But remember to also plant some crops on your own land that others can't take away.
