# Awakening from Digital Colonialism
## Rebuilding Rules of Survival on Free Platforms

When Facebook announces yet another algorithm adjustment,
Many people jump up in protest:

"Facebook has betrayed its original mission!"
"This is platform hegemony!"
"This company is finished!"

But don't you find this somewhat strange?

## Free Chicken Legs and the Tower of Babel

We've used Facebook for ten years.
As end users, we haven't paid the platform a single cent.

Within this massive system of 2 billion people, we've enjoyed humanity's first experience of internet-scale connectivity.
This is a modern Tower of Babel.
We check in, upload photos, and contact clients anytime, anywhere, with virtually no delay.

Behind this lies the platform's enormous capital investment and high-level talent.
Countless dollar signs are floating above it all.

We're like guests invited into a grand mansion,
eating free chicken legs provided by the host every day.

One day, the host says they're changing the rules of the game.
What right do we have to protest?

## Acknowledging the Reality of Digital Colonialism

In the past, we too hoped that domestic software could become global platforms.
But falling behind is falling behind—this is reality.

There's absolutely no shame in acknowledging that we are "digital colonies."

Understanding our actual circumstances helps us know how to move forward.
Those calls to "break free from Facebook's stranglehold"—just listen and move on.
Jump to Instagram, and it's still Facebook's; build your own website, and you're still constrained by Google's algorithms.

It's worth observing:
After algorithm adjustments, which industries cry the most tragically and pitifully?

Perhaps new opportunities are beckoning to us from that very direction.
