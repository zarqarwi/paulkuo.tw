title: "Faith Offers No Immunity: The Conflict Between Religious Reason and Social Reality"
description: "Viral transmission knows no race or creed. Any religious group claiming to shield real-world risks through 'sanctity' tramples upon social rationality. The cluster infection at South Korea's Shincheonji Church reveals that when believers isolate themselves from society, elevating private religious language above public safety, faith becomes a dangerous blind spot threatening society. Theological reflection must engage with lived reality, not merely point fingers at others as heretics."

# Faith Offers No Immunity
## The Conflict Between Religious Reason and Social Reality

South Korea's confirmed cases have surged to 433.
Behind this lies a cluster infection at the "Shincheonji Church."

This gives us a profoundly shocking revelation.

## Viruses Don't Care About Your Faith

Viral transmission knows no race.
Of course, it knows no faith either.

No matter how intimate the religious language you profess.
No matter how filled with sanctity you feel during worship gatherings.

You ultimately cannot separate yourself from society to form your own tribe.

## The Collision of Two Rationalities

The conflict between believers' "religious reason" and the public's "social reason" 
is omnipresent.

When religious groups believe "God will protect us" while ignoring epidemic prevention protocols,
this is not faith.
This is a threat to society.

If this incident can make theological reflection in various religious organizations more thorough and closer to lived reality,
that would be progress bought with painful lessons.

Rather than simply pointing fingers at others as heretics,
we should use our minds more to examine whether our own faith has become disconnected from reality.
