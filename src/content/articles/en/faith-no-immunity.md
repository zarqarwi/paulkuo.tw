title: "Faith Cannot Provide Immunity: The Conflict Between Religious Rationality and Social Reality"
description: "Viral transmission knows no race or faith. Any religious group claiming to use 'sanctity' to isolate themselves from real-world risks tramples upon social rationality. The cluster infection incident at South Korea's Shincheonji Church reveals that when believers isolate themselves from society and place private religious language above public safety, faith becomes a blind spot that endangers society. Theological reflection must engage with lived reality, rather than merely pointing arrogantly at others as heretics."

## Faith Cannot Provide Immunity
### The Conflict Between Religious Rationality and Social Reality

South Korea's confirmed cases have soared to 433.
Behind this lies the cluster infection at "Shincheonji Church."

This gives us an extraordinarily shocking revelation.

### The Virus Doesn't Care About Your Faith

Viral transmission knows no race.
Of course, it also knows no faith.

No matter how private the religious language you embrace.
No matter how filled with sanctity you feel during gatherings.

You ultimately cannot separate yourself from society and become a tribe unto yourself.

### The Collision of Two Rationalities

The conflict between believers' "religious rationality" and the public's "social rationality"
is actually omnipresent.

When religious groups believe "God will protect us" while ignoring epidemic prevention protocols,
this is not faith.
This is a threat to society.

If this incident can make theological reflection in various religious organizations more thorough and closer to lived reality,
then it would be progress gained through painful lessons.

Rather than simply pointing at others as heretics,
it would be better to use our minds more, examining whether our own faith has become disconnected from reality.
