title: "Faith Offers No Immunity: The Conflict Between Religious Rationality and Social Reality"
description: "Viral transmission recognizes no race or creed. Any religious community claiming to use 'sanctity' to insulate itself from real-world risks tramples upon social rationality. South Korea's Shincheonji Church cluster infection reveals this truth: when believers isolate themselves from society and elevate private religious language above public safety, faith becomes a blind spot that endangers society. Theological reflection must align with lived reality, rather than merely pointing arrogant fingers at others as heretics."

## Faith Offers No Immunity
### The Conflict Between Religious Rationality and Social Reality

South Korea's confirmed cases have surged to 433.
Behind this lies a cluster infection at the "Shincheonji Church."

This offers us a profoundly shocking revelation.

### The Virus Doesn't Care About Your Faith

Viral transmission recognizes no race.
Of course, it also recognizes no faith.

No matter how private your religious language.
No matter how filled with sanctity you feel during worship gatherings.

You cannot, ultimately, separate yourself from society and become your own tribe.

### The Collision of Two Rationalities

The conflict between believers' "religious rationality" and the public's "social rationality" 
is actually omnipresent.

When religious communities believe "God will protect us" while ignoring epidemic prevention protocols,
this is not faith.
This is a threat to society.

If this incident can make theological reflection across religious organizations more thorough and closer to lived reality,
then it represents progress earned through painful lessons.

Rather than simply pointing fingers at others as heretics,
we should exercise our minds more, examining whether our own faith has become disconnected from reality.
