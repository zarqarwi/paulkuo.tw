Innovation no longer depends on development efficiency, but on judging direction, deconstructing logic, and proposing 'features worth creating.' As AI becomes an automated integrator, humanity's role transforms into irreplaceable value curators."

When AI can write cleaner, more efficient code than I can, what value can I still provide?

The concept of the "Post-Code Era" has given me inspiration:
Our true value is shifting from "executing technology" to "defining problems and shaping taste."

## Elevating Thinking Under Technological Democratization

The rise of generative programming platforms (like Cursor) has relegated syntax and tools to the background.

The truly valuable skill is no longer writing lines of code.
It's the ability to define problems, decompose tasks, and clearly communicate requirements to AI in natural language.

"Vibe coding" means when I can make AI implement features with minimal phrases, I'm not "controlling machines" but "guiding logic."

## The Rise of Humanistic Literacy and Taste

In the AI era, linguistic sensitivity determines whether you can become a good designer.

Humanistic training (rhetoric, contextual interpretation) silently supports the quality of our interactions with AI.
"Taste" is not vague preference, but the perceptual ability for "how things should be done" and "how things are worth doing."

I'm like a coach.
The AI model runs on the field, while I'm responsible for deciding tactics and value trade-offs.
AI can offer suggestions, but cannot define aesthetics, cultural depth, and social context—this is where human taste becomes scarce.

## From Code Craftsman to Value Curator

Future core competitiveness is "thinking accurately," not just "writing fast."

We no longer merely satisfy user needs, but philosophically pursue the question: "What features are worth creating?"
The core of innovation has never been efficiency, but a sense of direction.

## Conclusion: Questions AI Cannot Proactively Answer

Humans won't be replaced by AI, but redefined.
We will increasingly become "curators of value."

Code can be copied, models can be trained.
But "what you choose to build"—this is something AI can never proactively answer.
