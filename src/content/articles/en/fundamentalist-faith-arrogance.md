## The Trap of Fundamentalism
### When Faith Becomes Self-Righteousness

The most dangerous aspect of fundamentalism is not its doctrinal content.
It's its obsession with certainty.

It transforms faith from a journey of constant questioning and humility
into a system that has "already found the answers."

Once you believe you possess all truth,
you no longer need to listen.
You no longer need dialogue.
You begin to judge.

### The Price of Certainty

Paul reminds us:
"Now we know in part."

But fundamentalists often live as if they know everything.

They know who will go to heaven.
They know who is sinning.
They know God's will.

This certainty makes them feel secure,
but it also causes them to lose faith's most precious quality:
humility.

### From Judgment to Understanding

True faith is not an answer, but a question.

It constantly asks:
Do I truly understand?
Am I missing something?
Am I mistaking my prejudices for God's will?

When faith becomes a process of constant questioning,
it won't become a weapon.
It will become a bridge.

### Conclusion

The problem with fundamentalism isn't faith itself.
It's that it freezes faith.

Truly living faith breathes.
It questions, it weeps, it gropes in darkness.
But precisely because of this, it has the power to lead people toward freedom.
