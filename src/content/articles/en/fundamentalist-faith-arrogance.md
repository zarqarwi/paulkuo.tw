## The Trap of Fundamentalism
### When Faith Becomes Self-Righteousness

The most dangerous aspect of fundamentalism is not its doctrinal content. It's the obsession with certainty.

It transforms faith from a journey of continuous questioning and humility into a system of "already having the answers."

Once you believe you possess all truth, you no longer need to listen. You no longer need dialogue. You begin to judge.

### The Price of Certainty

The Apostle Paul reminds us: "What we now know is limited."

But fundamentalists often live as if they know everything. They know who goes to heaven. They know who is sinning. They know God's will.

This certainty makes them feel safe, but it also costs them faith's most precious quality: **humility**.

### From Judgment to Understanding

True faith is not an answer but a question. It continuously asks: Have I truly understood? Am I missing something? Have I mistaken my own bias for God's intention?

When faith becomes a process of continuous questioning, it cannot become a weapon. It becomes a bridge.

### Conclusion

The problem with fundamentalism is not faith itself — it's that it freezes faith.

Truly living faith breathes. It questions, it weeps, it gropes in the dark. But precisely because of this, it has the power to lead people toward freedom.
