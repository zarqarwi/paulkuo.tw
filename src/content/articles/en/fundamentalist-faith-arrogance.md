title: "The Trap of Fundamentalism: When Faith Stops Asking and Starts Judging"
subtitle: "The most dangerous faith is not wrong faith, but faith that has stopped breathing"
description: "The core problem of fundamentalism is not doctrinal content, but its addiction to certainty. When someone believes they possess all truth, they lose the ability to listen and dialogue. Faith freezes from a continuous journey of questioning and humility into a system that cannot be challenged. This essay explores the cost of certainty, the power of humility, and how faith can maintain its core convictions while preserving the capacity to breathe."
abstract: |
  Fundamentalism casts its shadow across religions worldwide. Paul draws from his long-term observations within church circles to show that the real danger of fundamentalism isn't its doctrines, but that it stops faith from asking questions. When "I already know the answer" replaces "What might I be missing?" faith transforms from a bridge into a weapon. This essay isn't attacking any particular denomination, but invites every believer to examine themselves: Is your faith still breathing?

I knew a brother who had been Christian for over thirty years, reading scripture and praying daily, actively serving in his church. One day we were discussing a theological issue, and I shared a perspective different from his. He looked at me seriously and said: "That way of thinking is dangerous."

Not "I disagree," not "Let's discuss this." But "You are dangerous."

In that moment, I felt a deep sadness. Not because he opposed my view—different perspectives are normal. But because in his faith world, a different viewpoint wasn't a possibility worth exploring; it was a threat to be warned against.

This is the smell of fundamentalism.

## The Addiction to Certainty

What makes fundamentalism so seductive is that it offers certainty.

In a world where nothing seems certain, fundamentalism tells you: every word of the Bible is true, every rule is fixed, every question has a standard answer. You don't have to struggle in gray areas, because everything is black and white.

This certainty is addictive like a drug.

Because admitting "I'm not sure" is uncomfortable. Admitting "Maybe I'm wrong" is even more uncomfortable. Fundamentalism offers the perfect antidote: you don't have to face that discomfort, because the answer is already there. You only need to believe, obey, and exclude dissent.

The problem is, this certainty comes at a cost.

## The Cost: Losing the Ability to Listen

Apostle Paul reminded us in 1 Corinthians: "Our knowledge is incomplete."

This comes from one of Christianity's greatest theologians, someone who established much of the early church. Even he admitted his understanding was limited.

But many fundamentalists today live as if they know everything. They know who goes to heaven, who's sinning, God's exact position on every issue. They don't just "believe" something—they are "certain" their belief equals God's will.

When someone reaches this point, they lose the capacity to listen.

Because listening assumes the possibility that the other person knows something you don't. If you already know everything, why listen? Everyone else's perspective has only two options: agrees with you (confirming you're right), or differs from you (proving they're wrong).

Over many years in church circles, the image that breaks my heart most isn't theological debate. It's a young person gathering courage to voice their confusion in a small group, only to be shut down by an elder saying: "Your faith isn't strong enough." That young person's question might be immature, poorly worded, or genuinely confused—but they are asking. A faith community that stops asking is a community that's dying.

## The Temptation of Judgment

The second danger of fundamentalism is how easily it makes judgment.

When you believe you possess the complete version of truth, you automatically stand as judge. Others' behaviors, beliefs, choices can all be measured against your "standard" and declared acceptable or unacceptable.

This process doesn't even require malice. Many fundamentalists genuinely believe they're "helping others," "acting according to scripture." But the problem is: when you equate "my interpretation" with "God's standard," you're doing exactly what scripture warns against—putting yourself in God's place.

When Jesus walked the earth, his most frequent conflicts weren't with sinners, but with Pharisees—the most devout, rule-keeping, self-assured religious group of that era. This contrast deserves deep reflection from every believer.

## My Own Struggle

To be honest, I'm not immune either.

In my early faith, I also went through a period where I was "certain about everything." Back then faith seemed simple: read scripture, pray, follow rules, evangelize. When people asked why I believed, I could talk for an hour.

It was later, in theological seminary, that my certainty began to shake. Not making me lose faith, but making me discover that many things I thought "simple" were far more complex than I imagined. Biblical texts have their historical contexts, doctrines have their political struggles, different interpretive traditions have profound disagreements.

These discoveries didn't destroy my faith. Instead they transformed my faith from a "certainty-about-everything" flat structure into one that "acknowledges complexity and accepts tension" in a [three-dimensional way](/articles/same-sex-marriage-theology).

My faith now is not more "certain" than before. But I believe it's more honest, deeper, and more capable of breathing.

## Living Faith vs. Frozen Faith

So how do we distinguish between faith that is "alive" and faith that is "frozen"?

I have a very simple test: Is this faith community still asking questions?

If they're still asking "Are we missing something?" "Could this text be understood differently?" "Are our positions influenced by cultural bias?"—then this faith is alive. It's still breathing, growing, facing the challenges of the real world.

If they've stopped asking, if every answer is locked in place, if any doubt is treated as "faithlessness"—then this faith is frozen. It looks solid, but solidity and death are sometimes separated by only a thin line.

The problem with fundamentalism isn't faith itself. It's that it freezes faith.

True living faith can breathe. It questions, it cries, it searches in darkness. It's not afraid of "I'm uncertain," because it knows [certainty is not faith's goal—faithfulness is](/articles/god-beyond-definition).

And a believer of true faithfulness has one essential quality: not "knowing everything," but acknowledging their own limits, and choosing to trust within those limits.

This is harder than being certain about everything. But also far more beautiful.
