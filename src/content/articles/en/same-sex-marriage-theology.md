## Closed Texts and Open Worlds
### A Faith Reflection on the Same-Sex Marriage Constitutional Ruling

When Constitutional Interpretation No. 748 on "Same-Sex Marriage Freedom" was announced,
as a Christian who once studied theology and intended to enter ministry, my feelings were deeply conflicted.

I can fully understand
how friends who cannot accept this interpretation feel as though they've been violated by society.
When reasoned discourse fails, moral judgment inevitably follows.

But the root of the problem lies in how we view "truth."

### The Closure of Texts and the Trap of Literalism

Many evangelical believers uphold biblical truth, believing that the canon is closed.
All of life's answers—from relationships and finances to politics—are contained within these sixty-six books.

They employ literal interpretation.
Opening Leviticus or Romans, they see in black and white: "If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death."

From a literal reading, there indeed seems no room for compromise.

But they overlook the fact that:
The Apostle Paul never opposed slavery.
King David never opposed having thousands of concubines.

You cannot directly derive modern optimal marriage or political systems from this ancient text.

### Cultural Context and Communal Imagination

Before the Scientific Revolution, the world was simple, and religious leaders provided all knowledge.
But after the Enlightenment, we should possess the ability to analyze the social foundations of texts.

- The Pentateuch is filled with editorial traces from later hands.
- The 27 books of the New Testament weren't confirmed until 419 CE.

No religious text can be completely closed, requiring no dialogue with the world.
Christianity's canon is itself a cultural product filled with dialectic and conflict.

### Conclusion: The Leap of Faith

If we don't adjust our framework for understanding truth, how can the church dialogue with the world?

Every interpretive conflict presents an opportunity for a leap of faith.
We need theological reflection,
not self-imposed isolation that merely shouts "the world lies under the power of darkness."

Only by choosing such a theological stance can I teach my children,
and maintain consistency in my character from Monday through Sunday.
