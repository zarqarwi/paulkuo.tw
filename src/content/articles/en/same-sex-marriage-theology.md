description: "When religious texts refuse to engage in dialogue with the times, faith degenerates into an island severed from reality. When faith communities treat their own interpretations as the sole truth, they ultimately only marginalize themselves."

## Closed Texts and the Open World
### A Faith Reflection on the Same-Sex Marriage Constitutional Interpretation

When Constitutional Interpretation No. 748 on "The Freedom of Marriage for Same-Sex Couples" was announced,
as a Christian who has studied theology and intended to enter the priesthood, my feelings were deeply mixed.

I can completely understand
that friends who cannot accept this interpretation feel as if they've been violated by society.
When reasoning fails, moral judgment inevitably follows.

But the root of the problem lies in how we view "truth."

### The Closure of Texts and the Trap of Literal Meaning

Many evangelical believers uphold biblical truth, believing that the canon is closed.
All of life's answers—from relationships and finances to politics—are contained within these sixty-six books.

They employ literal interpretation.
Opening Leviticus or Romans, they find it written in black and white: "If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them shall be put to death."

From a literal perspective, there is indeed no room for compromise.

But they overlook the fact that:
The apostle Paul never opposed slavery.
King David never opposed having three thousand concubines.

You cannot directly derive the most suitable modern marriage or political systems from this ancient text.

### Cultural Context and Collective Imagination

Before the Scientific Revolution, the world was simple, and religious leaders provided all knowledge.
But after the Enlightenment, we should possess the ability to analyze the social foundations of texts.

- The Five Books of Moses are filled with traces of later editorial work.
- The 27 books of the New Testament were only confirmed in 419 CE.

No religious text can be completely closed, requiring no dialogue with the world.
The Christian canon is itself a cultural product filled with dialectics and conflicts.

### Conclusion: The Leap of Faith

If the framework for understanding truth isn't adjusted, how can the church engage in dialogue with the world?

Every interpretive conflict presents an opportunity for a leap of faith.
We need theological reflection,
not just the self-imposed isolation of shouting "the world lies under the power of darkness."

By choosing this theological stance, I can teach my children
and maintain consistency in my character from Monday through Sunday.
