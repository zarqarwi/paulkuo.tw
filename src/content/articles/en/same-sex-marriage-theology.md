## Theological Reflection on Same-Sex Marriage
### The Tension Between Love and Law

These past few days, the issue of same-sex marriage has set the entire society ablaze.
The reaction within church circles has been even more intense.

But I want to ask: Have we truly thought through this issue carefully?

Before rushing to take a stance, perhaps we should first quiet ourselves and do some basic homework:

What does the original text of Scripture actually say? What evolution has the church's position on this issue undergone throughout history?
What are the arguments of contemporary theologians? What are the best arguments on both the supporting and opposing sides?

If we haven't done this homework and are merely shouting slogans along with the crowd,
how is that different from the "instant noodle faith" we criticize?

The depth of faith is revealed in how we face the most difficult questions.
Not by avoidance, not by simplification, but by understanding with humility.

The tension between love and law is not a problem to be solved.
It is a weight we must learn to bear.
