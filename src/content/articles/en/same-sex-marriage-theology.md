# Closed Texts and an Open World
## A Faith Reflection on the Same-Sex Marriage Constitutional Ruling

When Constitutional Interpretation No. 748 on "Marriage Freedom for Same-Sex Couples" was announced,
as a Christian who has studied theology and once intended to pursue ordained ministry, my feelings were deeply mixed.

I can completely understand
that for friends who cannot accept this interpretation, it feels like being violated by society.
When reasoned discourse fails, moral judgment inevitably follows.

But the root of the problem lies in how we view "truth."

## Textual Closure and the Trap of Literalism

Many evangelical believers uphold biblical truth, believing that the canon is closed.
All of life's answers—from relationships and finances to politics—can be found in these sixty-six books.

They employ literal interpretation.
Opening Leviticus or Romans, they see in black and white: "If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death."

From a literal perspective, there is indeed no room for compromise.

But they overlook the fact that:
The apostle Paul never opposed slavery.
King David never opposed having three thousand concubines in his harem.

You cannot directly derive the most suitable modern marriage or political systems from this ancient text.

## Cultural Context and Communal Imagination

Before the Scientific Revolution, the world was simple, and religious leaders provided all knowledge.
But after the Enlightenment, we should possess the ability to analyze the social foundations of texts.

- The Pentateuch is filled with editorial traces from later periods.
- The 27 books of the New Testament were not confirmed until 419 CE.

No religious text can be completely closed, requiring no dialogue with the world.
Christianity's canon is itself a cultural product filled with dialectics and conflicts.

## Conclusion: The Leap of Faith

If we don't adjust our framework for understanding truth, how can the church dialogue with the world?

Every encounter with interpretive conflict is an opportunity for a leap of faith.
We need theological reflection,
not just the self-imposed isolation of crying out that "the world lies under the power of darkness."

By choosing this theological position, I can teach my children.
I can maintain consistency in my character from Monday through Sunday.
