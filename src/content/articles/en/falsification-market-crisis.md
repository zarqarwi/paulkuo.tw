title: "Revering the Boundaries of the Unknown: Using Falsificationist Thinking to Face Market Crises"
description: "In a world full of black swans, blind confidence is fatal. We habitually frame the future through the lens of known experiences, but true risk management is built upon the humility of acknowledging that 'things-in-themselves are unknowable.' Whether responding to capital market crashes or facing the spread of global pandemics, constantly questioning ourselves, rehearsing extreme scenarios, and admitting that we are 'blind men touching an elephant' every day—this is the only antidote to avoiding devastating losses and coexisting with crisis."

## Revering the Boundaries of the Unknown
### Using Falsificationist Thinking to Face Market Crises

Watching the confirmed cases and death toll from COVID-19 continuously climb.
My reflexive response is to ask myself:

When will global confirmed cases break 100,000? Deaths break 5,000?

### The Questioning Method for Detecting Trends

In my past experience trading financial instruments, I developed a habit:
Using "questioning" to detect trends.

Before market open, I would ask myself:
- What might today's trend profile look like?
- If there's a sudden crash, what should I do?
- If there's a sudden surge, how should I handle it?
- What kind of movement would be unexpected for me?

Pre-planning enables proper risk management when the unexpected occurs.

### The Reality of Blind Men and the Elephant

We must acknowledge:
"Things-in-themselves are unknowable."

Capital markets are larger than we imagine. So is the world.

The data we collect is only partial.
Our eyes are full of bias and prejudice.
The information we interpret is full of potential errors.

Every day, we are blind men touching an elephant.

### Conclusion: Taking Responsibility for Our Own Judgment

Facing the market, only caution and humility will suffice.
Otherwise, millions in losses can disappear in the blink of an eye, and your heart won't be able to take it.

A loss is a loss.
Diplomas, connections, family background—none of these matter before the market.

In the moment of trading and living, there's no need to spend time debating with others about the reasons behind trends.
Leave that to the experts and scholars.

What you need is:
To generate clear insights yourself, and take responsibility for yourself.

What cannot be blocked, learn to coexist with.
