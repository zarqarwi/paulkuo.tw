title: "Reverence for the Boundaries of the Unknown: Facing Market Crises with Falsificationist Thinking"
description: "In a world full of black swans, blind confidence is deadly. We habitually frame the future with known experiences, but true risk management is built upon the humility of acknowledging that 'things-in-themselves are unknowable.' Whether responding to capital market crashes or facing global pandemic spread, constantly questioning ourselves, rehearsing extreme scenarios, and admitting we are 'blind men feeling an elephant' every day—this is the only antidote to avoiding devastating losses and coexisting with crisis."

## Reverence for the Boundaries of the Unknown
### Facing Market Crises with Falsificationist Thinking

Watching the confirmed cases and death toll from COVID-19 continuously climb,
my reflexive response is to ask myself:

When will global confirmed cases break 100,000? Deaths exceed 5,000?

### The Art of Trend Detection Through Questioning

During my past experience trading financial instruments, I developed a habit:
using "questions" to probe trends.

Before market open, I would ask myself:
- What might today's price action look like?
- If there's a sudden selloff, what should I do?
- If there's a sudden surge, how should I handle it?
- What kind of movement would catch me off guard?

Only by thinking ahead can we manage risk when the unexpected occurs.

### The Reality of Blind Men and the Elephant

We must acknowledge:
"Things-in-themselves are unknowable."

Capital markets are larger than we imagine. So is the world.

The data we collect is only partial.
Our eyes are filled with bias and prejudice.
The information we interpret carries the possibility of error.

Every day, we are blind men feeling an elephant.

### Conclusion: Taking Responsibility for Our Own Judgment

Facing markets requires only caution and humility.
Otherwise, millions in losses can disappear in a blink, and hearts cannot bear it.

A loss is a loss.
Diplomas, connections, family background—all useless before the market.

In the moments of trading and living, there's no need to waste time debating the reasons behind price movements with others.
Leave that to the experts and scholars.

What you need is:
to generate clear insights yourself, to take responsibility for yourself.

What cannot be stopped, learn to coexist with it.
