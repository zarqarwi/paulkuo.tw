title: "Revering the Boundaries of the Unknown: Facing Market Crises with Falsification Thinking"
description: "In a world filled with black swan events, blind confidence is fatal. We habitually frame the future through the lens of known experience, but true risk management is built upon the humility of acknowledging that 'things-in-themselves are unknowable.' Whether responding to capital market crashes or facing global pandemic spread, constantly questioning ourselves, rehearsing extreme scenarios, and admitting that we are 'blind men touching an elephant' every day—this is the only antidote to avoiding devastating losses and coexisting with crisis."

## Revering the Boundaries of the Unknown
### Facing Market Crises with Falsification Thinking

Watching the COVID-19 confirmed cases and death toll continuously climb,
my reflexive response is to ask myself:

When will global confirmed cases break 100,000? Deaths exceed 5,000?

### The Art of Questioning to Detect Trends

During my time trading financial instruments, I developed a habit:
using "questions" to probe trends.

Before market open, I would ask myself:
- What might today's trend profile look like?
- If there's a sudden sell-off, what should I do?
- If there's a sudden surge, how should I handle it?
- What kind of movement would surprise me?

Pre-visualization enables proper risk management when the unexpected occurs.

### The Reality of Blind Men and the Elephant

We must acknowledge:
"Things-in-themselves are unknowable."

Capital markets are more vast than we imagine. So is the world.

The data we collect is only partial.
Our eyes are full of bias and preconceptions.
The information we interpret is rife with potential errors.

Every day, we are blind men touching an elephant.

### Conclusion: Taking Responsibility for Our Own Judgment

Facing markets, only caution and humility will suffice.
Otherwise, millions in losses can disappear in the blink of an eye—the heart cannot bear it.

A loss is a loss.
Diplomas, connections, family background—all useless before the market.

In the moment of trading and living, don't waste time debating the reasons behind market movements with others.
Leave that to the experts and scholars.

What you need is:
to generate clear insights for yourself, and take responsibility for yourself.

What cannot be stopped, learn to coexist with it.
