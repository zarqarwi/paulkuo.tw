title: "JD.com's AI Supply Chain: When Prediction Becomes Infrastructure, What Should Taiwanese Enterprises See?"
description: "JD.com has used AI to rebuild its entire supply chain—from demand forecasting to unmanned delivery, from explainable models to automated warehousing. Stanford wrote it up as a case study, but for Taiwanese enterprises, the real signal isn't the technology—it's that supply chain capabilities are becoming exportable platforms."

Last June, I compiled a piece on JD.com's AI supply chain case study shared at Stanford University. At the time, my feeling was: this is a solid record of internal enterprise transformation, worth learning from but somewhat distant from us.

Nine months later, looking back, my assessment has changed. Not because JD.com has done something remarkable again, but because what they've done is becoming a kind of "standard"—when AI-driven supply chains shift from competitive advantage to basic infrastructure, enterprises that fail to keep up aren't just "missing a tool," they're "missing a layer of infrastructure."

This transformation demands serious attention from Taiwan's manufacturing and service industries.

## From Stanford Podium to Academic Paper: The JD Model Gets Formally Documented

Let me start with a noteworthy signal. In 2025, Stanford Graduate School of Business supply chain management expert Hau L. Lee and Professor Shen Zuyun from Zhejiang University formalized JD.com's AI supply chain practices into an academic paper, published on SSRN. The paper uses the classic "Triple-A" framework—Agility, Adaptability, and Alignment—to analyze three specific JD cases.

What does this represent? It means JD's approach is no longer just "internal enterprise optimization," but has been recognized as an industry template with universal value. The distance from corporate presentation to academic case study is significant.

## Three Layers of Capability: Prediction, Explanation, Optimization

JD's AI supply chain isn't a single system, but rather three layers of stacked capabilities.

The first layer is intelligent prediction. JD possesses shopping behavior data from over 600 million users, real-time inventory from 1,500 self-operated warehouses, plus external variables like weather, holidays, and geopolitical factors. The predictive models trained on this data have improved accuracy by nearly 15%. More critically, they use "synthetic data"—simulating historical successful transactions through deep learning—to augment training samples, allowing models to maintain stability even when facing unprecedented market volatility.

The second layer is explainability. This is an aspect many enterprises overlook when implementing AI. No matter how accurate predictions are, if business teams don't trust, understand, or dare to use them, it's worthless. JD decomposes each prediction result into "baseline value + contribution values from various factors," making AI recommendations comprehensible to sales, marketing, and logistics departments. They even provide three promotional strategies for individual products, each corresponding to different costs and expected returns, letting brand partners choose for themselves.

The third layer is operational optimization. Traditional logistics optimization requires professional operations research (OR) background—complex modeling and difficult adjustments. JD has made this layer accessible through natural language too—you input "ship 1,000 items to three warehouses at lowest cost," and the system automatically converts this into mathematical models, retrieves latest transportation costs, and generates solutions. It can also perform what-if analysis: if a warehouse fails or a route is disrupted, what are the alternatives?

These three layers combined don't just mean "AI helps you work"—they mean "AI helps you think."

## Nine Months Later: From Internal Tools to External Platforms

When I wrote the original piece last year, JD's AI supply chain primarily served itself. Now it has clearly moved toward platform-based export.

After upgrading "Logistics Super Brain 2.0," it's no longer just an automation tool. Through three mechanisms—global perception, model evolution, and human-machine collaboration—it transforms operational processes that previously relied on human experience into data-driven dynamic decision-making. Data shows: operational standardization levels improved 15%, personnel-vehicle-cargo-facility scheduling efficiency increased nearly 20%, and human-machine collaboration efficiency improved over 20%.

In robotics, JD's "Wolf Pack" series products—Smart Wolf, Sky Wolf, Ground Wolf, Flying Wolf, Lone Wolf, Wing Wolf—plus automated sorting walls, have been deployed in over 500 warehouses globally. In July 2025, JD also released its self-developed unmanned light truck "JD Logistics VAN," featuring 400km full-load range and L4-level public road autonomous driving capabilities.

More noteworthy is the business model transformation. JD Industrial (JDi) received Hong Kong Stock Exchange IPO approval in 2025, positioned as an "industrial supply chain technology and services platform," with first-half revenue of 10.3 billion RMB, up nearly 19% year-over-year. This essentially packages JD's accumulated AI capabilities in supply chain into products for sale to other enterprises.

Meanwhile, JD Logistics' international brand JoyExpress has officially entered Europe (UK, Netherlands, Germany, France), while JoyLogistics has deepened its presence in the Middle East, signing strategic cooperation with FII Institute covering digital transformation, logistics infrastructure, and cross-border commerce. JD was selected for Gartner's Global Supply Chain Top 25 for the second consecutive year.

The model is clear: first use AI to optimize your own supply chain, accumulate data and models, then transform this capability into an external platform. Supply chain is no longer just a cost center, but a profit center.

## Why Taiwanese Enterprises Should Care

At this point, someone might say: JD is a Chinese e-commerce giant with 600 million users and 1,500 warehouses—what does this have to do with Taiwan's SMEs?

The relationship is significant, but not about copying JD—it's about understanding the trend.

The first signal is: AI supply chain capabilities are shifting from "build" to "rent." JD Industrial's IPO, SaaS-ified supply chain services, API-fied logistics interfaces—all point to the same thing: future SMEs won't need to build their own AI teams, but will connect to AI supply chain platforms built by others. The question is, whose platform will you connect to?

The second signal is: explainability determines whether AI can truly land. JD invested enormous effort in "making business teams understand AI decisions"—this isn't a technical problem, it's a trust problem. Many Taiwanese enterprises fail at AI implementation not because models are inaccurate, but because frontline staff don't trust or dare to follow AI recommendations.

The third signal is: the competitive dimension of supply chain is changing. Previously it was about "whose logistics is faster and cheaper," now it's about "whose predictions are more accurate, responses faster, and exception handling more automated." When JD's AI system can automatically redistribute routes the instant a warehouse fails, this isn't an efficiency advantage—it's a structural advantage.

For Taiwan's manufacturing and supply chain service providers, the real question is: when your customers start interfacing with you using AI-driven supply chains while you're still managing inventory with Excel, you're not "slower"—you're speaking different languages.

## The Essence Seen Through JD

Returning to the core of JD's case. When they shared at Stanford last year, they emphasized four success conditions: cross-disciplinary talent, leadership support, flat organization, and massive data.

Nine months later, I think the most important is actually just one: whether the organization is willing to let AI participate in decision-making, not just generate reports.

Many enterprises' AI implementation stops at "AI does analysis, humans make decisions." JD has reached "AI makes recommendations, humans select options," and in some areas has even achieved "AI makes decisions, humans monitor exceptions." The gap between these three stages isn't a technology gap—it's a trust gap.

JD's case tells us: AI supply chain isn't something you can achieve by buying software and hiring a data scientist. It's a systematic transformation involving organizational culture, decision processes, and data governance. Technology is the easiest part, talent is the next hardest, and the hardest is getting an organization accustomed to "human authority" to learn to trust data and models.

This challenge faces every company, regardless of size or industry.
