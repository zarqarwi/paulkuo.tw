title: "Even a Rotten Crutch Provides Support: Humbly Facing the Faith of the Elderly Generation"
description: "When confronted with the 'economics of good deeds' and religious merit-based thinking that elders are passionate about, younger generations often attempt to deconstruct and debate using logic and reason. However, for elderly people who have lost their life's center and are aging alone, these seemingly absurd beliefs serve as genuine spiritual anchors in their real lives. This is a rotten crutch that can still support them as they continue walking. True humility means acknowledging the limitations of reason and embracing these forces that accompany the elderly in their solitary journey, because blood ties and emotions ultimately transcend rational dialectics."

## Even a Rotten Crutch Provides Support
### Humbly Facing the Faith of the Elderly Generation

The family home on New Year's Eve is always filled with generational clashes.

My simple-hearted mother enthusiastically shares the benefits of religious groups:
The advantages of lighting prayer lamps, the merit transfer of good deeds, the benefits of pilgrimage.

Meanwhile, her self-taught son launches into a rational barrage of questions:
"Why can merit be accumulated?"
"If removing stones accumulates virtue, could I accumulate more merit by moving them back and forth repeatedly?"

Grandma's expression gradually turns from pleasant to sour, finally ending with "Aiya~ I won't talk to you about this anymore."

### Blood Ties Beyond Reason

The dialogue between grandparent and grandchild is destined to have no logical intersection.
But red envelopes are still given, and red envelopes are still received.

Because kinship remains, affection remains.
Blood ties are bonds more intimate than reason can transcend.

Privately, I don't endorse that kind of "economics of good deeds." I don't believe that doing good deeds can accumulate merit in heaven, much less that prayer lamps bought with worldly money can secure next year's blessings.

But I suddenly had a realization:
A rotten crutch, if it still works, is still good.

### Anchor for a Weightless Life

Since father passed away, my always-dependent mother suddenly lost her sense of direction and purpose.
She lost almost all of her life.

The elderly grow older as time passes.
Those religious beliefs that accompanied them through the last century may seem like passing clouds to young people, but to them they are incomparably real sources of support.

What comforts their lonely hearts is often not their busy children.

Without these "rotten crutches" accompanying the elders in our families as they trudge forward alone, providing them with spiritual anchor,
we young people who struggle outside, thinking we're pushing the world forward, would probably lose more than half our strength to charge ahead.

### Conclusion

Humility has never been an easy lesson.
It contains elements of compromise and surrender.

When we can sometimes speak eloquently and expound our views,
it's often merely out of ignorance and naivety.

Life is not just rational discussion.
Life is truly, genuinely living.
