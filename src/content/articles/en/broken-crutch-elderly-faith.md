title: "Even a Rotten Crutch Provides Support: Humbly Facing the Faith of the Elderly Generation"
description: "Faced with elders' enthusiasm for 'good deeds economics' and religious merit theory, younger generations often attempt deconstruction and debate through logic and reason. However, for elders who have lost their life's center and age in loneliness, these seemingly absurd beliefs serve as genuine spiritual anchors in their real lives. This is a rotten crutch that still enables them to keep walking. True humility means acknowledging the limitations of reason and embracing these forces that accompany elders on their solitary journey, because blood relations and emotions ultimately transcend rational dialectics."

## Even a Rotten Crutch Provides Support
### Humbly Facing the Faith of the Elderly Generation

On New Year's Eve at home, generational clashes always fill the air.

My simple mother enthusiastically shares the help from religious groups:
The benefits of lighting blessing lamps, the merit transfer from good deeds, the advantages of pilgrimage.

Meanwhile, her self-educated son launches a rational barrage of questions:
"Why can merit be accumulated?"
"If removing stones accumulates virtue, could I gain more merit by moving them back and forth repeatedly?"

Grandmother's expression gradually shifts from pleasant to green, finally ending with "Aiya~ I won't talk to you about this anymore."

### Blood Relations Beyond Reason

The dialogue between grandparent and grandchild is destined to have no logical intersection.
But the red envelopes are still given, and still received.

Because kinship remains, affection remains.
Blood relations are bonds tighter than reason.

I privately don't subscribe to that kind of "good deeds economics." I don't believe that accumulated merit can be stored in heaven, nor that blessing lamps purchased with earthly currency can reserve next year's blessings.

But I suddenly had a realization:
A rotten crutch, if it still works, is still good.

### Anchors for a Weightless Life

Since father passed away, mother, who had always been dependent, suddenly lost her sense of direction and purpose.
She lost almost her entire life.

The elderly grow older with each passing day.
Those religious beliefs that accompanied them through the last century may seem like fleeting clouds to young people, but for them they are incomparably real sources of support.

What comforts their lonely hearts is often not their busy children.

Without these "rotten crutches" accompanying the elders in our homes on their solitary journey, providing them with spiritual anchor,
we young people rushing about outside, thinking we're pushing the world forward, would probably lose more than half our driving force.

### Conclusion

Humility has never been an easy lesson.
It contains elements of compromise and surrender.

When we can sometimes speak eloquently and expound our views,
it's often merely out of ignorance and naivety.

Life is not just rational discourse.
Life is truly, genuinely living.
