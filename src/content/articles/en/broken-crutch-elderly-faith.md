title: "Even a Rotten Crutch Provides Support: Humbly Facing the Faith of the Elderly Generation"
description: "When confronted with the 'economics of good deeds' and religious merit theories that captivate older generations, younger people often attempt to deconstruct and debate using logic and reason. Yet for elders who have lost their life's center and age in loneliness, these seemingly absurd beliefs serve as genuine spiritual anchors in their daily lives. This is a rotten crutch that still enables them to keep walking. True humility means acknowledging the limitations of reason and embracing these forces that accompany the elderly in their solitary journey, because blood ties and emotion ultimately transcend rational discourse."

# Even a Rotten Crutch Provides Support
## Humbly Facing the Faith of the Elderly Generation

The family home on New Year's Eve is always filled with generational clashes.

My simple-hearted mother enthusiastically shares the benefits of religious organizations:
the advantages of lighting prayer lamps, the merit transfer from good deeds, the benefits of pilgrimage.

Meanwhile, her self-educated son launches a barrage of rational questioning:
"Why can merit be accumulated?"
"If moving stones away is virtuous, could I accumulate more merit by carrying them back and forth?"

Grandmother's expression gradually shifts from pleasant to sour, finally ending with "Aiya~ I won't talk to you anymore."

## Blood Ties Beyond Reason

The dialogue between generations is destined to have no logical intersection.
But red envelopes are still given, and red envelopes are still received.

Because kinship remains, affection remains.
Blood ties are bonds more intimate than reason.

I privately don't endorse that kind of "economics of good deeds"—I don't believe that accumulated merit can be stored in heaven, nor that prayer lamps purchased with earthly currency can reserve next year's blessings.

But I suddenly had a realization:
A rotten crutch, if it still works, is still good.

## Anchors for a Life in Free Fall

Since father's departure, my always-dependent mother suddenly lost her sense of direction and purpose.
She lost almost everything that was her life.

The elderly grow older with each passing day.
Those religious beliefs that accompanied them through the last century may seem like floating clouds to young people, but to them they are incredibly real sources of support.

What comforts their lonely hearts is often not their busy children.

If these "rotten crutches" weren't there to accompany the elders in our families as they trudge forward alone, providing them with spiritual anchor,
we young people who fight battles outside, thinking we're pushing the world forward, would probably lose much of our strength to charge ahead.

## Conclusion

Humility has never been an easy lesson.
It contains elements of compromise and surrender.

When we can sometimes speak eloquently and expound our views,
it's often merely out of ignorance and naivety.

Life is not just rational discourse.
Life is living, truly and authentically.
