## Seeing Ourselves in the Information Deluge
### The Value Spectrum of Social Media Posts

Scrolling through Facebook every day.
What kind of posts make you pause, never growing tired of reading them?

From personal observation, there are four characteristics.

### Digital Embodiment of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty

First type: High knowledge content.
After reading, you feel like your brain has been upgraded. This is the desire for truth.

Second type: Sincere and moving.
Bursting with positive energy, inspiring you like morphine, making you push forward even with broken bones. This is resonance with goodness.

Third type: Pleasing to the eye.
Beautiful landscapes, adorable pets, handsome men and beautiful women.
Cuteness needs no explanation, like the biological mechanism of automatic eye tracking. This is pure appreciation of beauty.

The last type: Humorous with memes.
Making you forget for a few moments of hearty laughter that you're still fighting battles in hell.

Knowledge is truth, inspiration is goodness, beautiful scenery and people heal body and soul.

### The Noise of ME ME ME

In contrast, there is another extreme.

In every piece of writing, only emphasizing "ME ME ME."
Proclaiming how wonderful oneself is.

Should we be like bees carrying pollen, spreading truth and beauty?
Or should we infinitely inflate our egos through countless posts?

This is each person's individual choice.

### Conclusion

Some people's articles, even when algorithms don't push them,
we actively click into during our free moments to "consume spiritual nourishment," satisfying our hungry souls.

On the digital wall, every trace we leave
silently declares who we are.
