Scrolling through Facebook every day.

### The Digital Embodiment of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty

The first type: High knowledge content.
After reading, you feel like your brain has been upgraded. This is the desire for truth.

The second type: Sincere and moving.
Positive energy erupts, inspiring you like a shot of morphine, making you press forward even if you break your bones. This is the resonance with goodness.

The third type: Pleasing to the eye.
Beautiful scenery, adorable pets, handsome men and beautiful women.
Cuteness needs no explanation, like the biological mechanism of eyes automatically tracking. This is pure appreciation of beauty.

The last type: Humor with wit.
Letting you temporarily forget you're still fighting in hell during those few seconds of hearty laughter.

Knowledge is truth, inspiration is goodness, beautiful scenery and people heal body and mind.

### The Noise of ME ME ME

At the opposite extreme is another type.

In every piece of writing, only emphasizing "ME ME ME."
Proclaiming how awesome they are.

Should we be like bees carrying pollen, transmitting truth and goodness outward?
Or should we infinitely inflate our ego through countless posts?

This is each person's individual choice.

we still actively click into during our spare time to "consume spiritual nourishment," satisfying our hungry hearts.

On the digital wall, every trace we leave behind
silently explains who we are.
