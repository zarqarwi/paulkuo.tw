## Seeing Ourselves in the Information Flood
### The Value Spectrum of Social Media Posts

Every day we scroll through Facebook.
What kind of posts make you pause your finger, never getting tired of reading them?

From personal observation, there are four characteristics.

### Digital Embodiment of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty

First type: High knowledge content.
After reading, you feel like your brain has been upgraded. This is the desire for truth.

Second type: Sincere and moving.
Positive energy erupts, inspiring you like a shot of morphine, making you want to move forward even if your bones are broken. This is resonance with goodness.

Third type: Pleasing to the eye.
Beautiful scenery, cute pets, handsome men and beautiful women.
Cuteness needs no explanation, like the biological mechanism of eyes automatically tracking. This is pure appreciation of beauty.

The last type: Humorous with memes.
Making you forget for a few seconds of hearty laughter that you're still fighting in hell.

Knowledge is truth, inspiration is goodness, beautiful scenes and people heal body and mind.

### The Noise of ME ME ME

On the opposite extreme is another type.

In every piece of writing, only emphasizing "ME ME ME."
Proclaiming how awesome oneself is.

Should we be like bees carrying pollen, transmitting truth and beauty?
Or should we infinitely inflate our egos in countless posts?

This is each person's individual choice.

### Conclusion

Some people's articles, even when algorithms don't push them,
we still actively click in during spare moments to "eat spiritual food," satisfying our hungry souls.

On the digital wall, every trace we leave
silently explains who we are.
