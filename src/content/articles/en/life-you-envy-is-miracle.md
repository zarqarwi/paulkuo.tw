title: "The Life You Envy Is Already Someone Else's Miracle"
description: "We often resent our circumstances through social comparison, forgetting that we already enjoy the 'civilization dividends' of stable electricity, healthcare, and freedom. Zoom out, and our ordinary daily lives are the miracles that billions dream of. Instead of agonizing over starting lines, we should learn humility and build our own irreplaceable path. The world isn't fair, but we can choose the angle from which we face it."

# The Life You Envy
## Is Already Someone Else's Miracle

We spend our time envying other people's lives, forgetting that the life we live is already a miracle in someone else's eyes.

### The Luxury of Civilization's Dividends
Today, you can safely browse the internet, enjoy stable electricity and healthcare—already far beyond the daily reality of most people on this planet.
We feel devastated about "not being able to afford our dream home." That frustration itself is a luxury granted by civilization.

### Becoming the Only Path
Kevin Kelly once said: "Don't try to be the best. Be the only."
Instead of agonizing over losing at the starting line, build the path that only you can walk. What truly matters is whether you know who you are and how you choose to live.

### Conclusion
The world isn't fair, but our circumstances are already far better than the vast majority of people throughout history.
Your life didn't start from zero. You're already standing on a road that was paved long ago. For many people, that road itself is the miracle.
