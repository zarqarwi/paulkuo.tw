title: "The Life You Envy Is Already Someone Else's Miracle"
subtitle: "In the anxiety of social comparison, we forget we're standing at the best position in human history"
description: "We spend vast amounts of time on social media envying others' lives—their travels, their income, their freedom. But if you shift your perspective from Instagram to the globe, you'll discover an uncomfortable truth: the life you're living right now is a miracle to most people on Earth. Stable utilities, accessible healthcare, the right to freely choose your career—these aren't 'basic,' they're historical exceptions. This article isn't asking you to stop pursuing a better life, but to first see clearly where you already stand before you pursue more."
abstract: |
  Paul starts from his own experience of social media anxiety and discovers a paradox: the more we connect globally, the more inadequate we feel about ourselves. But if we change our comparison target from 'that friend who went to the Maldives' to 'the average of seven billion people worldwide,' the picture becomes completely different. This article combines Kevin Kelly's philosophy of 'becoming the only one' to explore why 'knowing you're already fortunate' isn't an excuse to stop striving, but rather the starting point for repositioning the direction of your efforts.

A few nights ago, I was lying in bed scrolling through my phone, watching yet another friend's European vacation stories on Instagram. The blue Aegean Sea, white Santorini buildings, an expensive-looking cup of coffee.

My first reaction was: That looks nice.

My second reaction was: Why am I still here.

My third reaction was—wait, what's actually wrong with "here"?

---

That "wait" is something I've been thinking about for a long time since.

We live inside a comparison machine. The essence of social media is presenting curated slices of life—the best angles, the best lighting, the best moments. No one posts "worked overtime until 11 PM and came home to cold takeout" on Instagram. You only see everyone else's highlights, then compare them to your everyday reality.

This comparison is unfair from the start, but our brains don't care about fairness. They just keep saying: you're not good enough, you don't make enough money, you're not free enough, you don't travel far enough.

But what if we changed our coordinate system for comparison?

---

Instead of comparing with friends' Instagram stories, compare with the entire planet.

According to World Bank data, over 700 million people worldwide still live below the extreme poverty line—surviving on less than $2.15 per day. About 2 billion people globally lack access to safe drinking water. In many African and South Asian countries, a simple case of pneumonia could kill a child because the nearest medical facility is fifty kilometers away.

This morning you woke up and turned on the tap to clean water. You flipped a switch and the lights came on. When you feel unwell, you can walk to a clinic to see a doctor. You can freely choose your career, your partner, your beliefs.

These aren't "basic." These are exceptions in human history.

Throughout humanity's 200,000 years of existence, for most of that time, most humans lived with hunger, disease, violence, and short lives. Everything you enjoy now—stable food supply, modern healthcare, rule of law, information freedom—has only existed for the past one or two centuries, and only in a small portion of the planet.

You're not "ordinary." From a statistical perspective, you're one of the luckiest few in human history.

---

But I know this kind of "you should be grateful" rhetoric sounds cheap.

Every time someone tells you "think about the children in Africa," your internal response is probably "so what, my anxiety is still here."

That's right, the anxiety is still there. Because gratitude isn't a switch you can flip to turn off anxiety. Comparison is human instinct—you can't shut it off by reading one article.

But what you can do is: adjust your reference point.

Psychologists call this the "reference point effect." Your happiness doesn't depend on how much you have, but on who you compare yourself to. If your reference point is "that friend who went to Santorini," you'll never be good enough. If your reference point is "the average standard throughout human history," you're already a miracle.

Same person, same life, different coordinates—completely different story.

During my years working at SDTI, I witnessed various "successful people's" anxieties.

CEOs with companies generating hundreds of millions in revenue worried about why it wasn't billions. Companies that had secured international clients worried about why they weren't bigger international clients. Managers leading ten-person teams worried about why the department next door had thirty people.

Everyone compared themselves to someone "one level higher." This ladder of comparison has no end—no matter which rung you climb to, there's always someone above.

I gradually came to understand that the problem with this ladder isn't that you "can't reach the top," but that "it's not your ladder to begin with."

Kevin Kelly said something I've always remembered: "Don't try to be the best; try to be the only."

The power of this statement lies in how it completely jumps out of the comparison framework. When you pursue being "the best," you're always comparing with others. When you pursue being "the only," you only need to dialogue with yourself.

---

But "becoming the only" isn't something you can achieve with just an inspirational quote.

It requires you to first answer a very uncomfortable question: Who are you, really?

Not your title, not your income, not your social media metrics. But—what remains after you strip away all these external labels. What do you care about? What are you willing to spend time on? What makes you forget to check your phone while you're doing it?

It took me many years to even begin approaching answers to these questions. My theological training taught me one thing: before you can help others, you must first face yourself. Those years of theological reflection forced me to dismantle many of my supposed "sense of mission"—how much was real, and how much was just satisfying my own vanity.

This dismantling process was painful, but it's also the necessary path to "becoming the only."

---

So this article isn't saying "you're already happy, don't complain."

Complaining is okay. Anxiety is normal. Wanting a better life is human nature.

But before you set out to pursue a better life, first look down at the ground beneath your feet.

You have clean water to drink. You have stable electricity. You have the freedom to choose. You can read anything you want to read, including this article.

This isn't the "basic package." This is a miracle.

Not because you did something special to earn it—but because you happened to be born in this era in this corner of the world. This luck isn't for self-congratulation—it's to remind you: you're already standing in a position most people can only dream of.

From this position, go walk the path that only you can walk. Not because others are walking it, but because it's yours.
