title: "The Life You Envy Is Already Someone Else's Miracle"
subtitle: "In the anxiety of social comparison, we forgot we're standing at the best position in human history"
description: "We spend enormous amounts of time on social media envying others' lives—their travels, their income, their freedom. But if we pull our perspective from Instagram to the global scale, you'll find an uncomfortable truth: the life you're living right now is a miracle to most people on Earth. Stable water and electricity, accessible healthcare, the freedom to choose your career—these aren't \"basics,\" they're historical exceptions. This article isn't asking you to stop pursuing a better life, but rather to see clearly where you're already standing before you pursue."
abstract: |
  Paul starts from his own anxiety experience on social media and discovers a paradox: the more connected we are globally, the less good enough we feel. But if we change our comparison point from \"that friend who went to Maldives\" to \"the average of seven billion people on Earth,\" the picture becomes completely different. This article combines Kevin Kelly's philosophy of \"becoming the only\" to explore why \"knowing you're already lucky\" isn't an excuse to stop trying, but rather the starting point for repositioning your effort.

A few nights ago, I was lying in bed scrolling through my phone, seeing my friend's photos of a European trip on their story for the hundredth time. The blue Aegean Sea, white Santorini, an expensive-looking coffee.

My first reaction was: wow, lucky them.

My second reaction was: how come I'm still here.

My third reaction was—wait, what's so wrong with "here"?

---

This "wait" was something I thought about for a long time afterward.

We live in a comparison machine. The nature of social media is to present carefully curated life snippets—the best angle, the best lighting, the best moments. Nobody posts "came home at 11 pm after overtime to find only cold leftovers" on Instagram. What you see is always someone else's highlight reel, which you then compare against your daily life.

This comparison is unfair from the start, but our brains don't care about fairness. It just keeps saying: you're not good enough, you don't have enough money, you're not free enough, you haven't traveled far enough.

But what if we change the coordinate system of comparison?

---

Instead of comparing to your friends' stories, compare to the entire planet.

According to World Bank data, over 700 million people globally still live below the extreme poverty line—less than $2.15 per day. About 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. In many African and South Asian countries, a common case of pneumonia can take a child's life because the nearest medical facility is fifty kilometers away.

This morning you woke up, turned on the tap and had clean water. You flipped a switch and the light came on. You felt unwell and could walk to a clinic to see a doctor. You can freely choose your career, your partner, your beliefs.

These aren't "basics." These are exceptions in human history.

In the 200,000 years humans have existed, for most of that time, most human lives consisted of: hunger, disease, violence, short lifespans. Everything you enjoy now—stable food supply, modern medicine, rule of law, information freedom—appeared only in the last 100-200 years, and only in a small part of the globe.

You're not an "ordinary person." From a statistical perspective, you're one of the luckiest people in human history.

---

But I know this "you should be grateful" argument sounds cheap.

Every time someone tells you "think of the children in Africa," your inner response is probably "so what, my anxiety is still here."

You're right, the anxiety is still here. Because gratitude isn't a switch you flip to turn off anxiety. Comparison is human nature; you can't turn it off with an article.

But what you can do is: adjust your reference point.

Psychologists call this the "reference point effect." Your happiness doesn't depend on how much you have, but on who you're comparing yourself to. If your reference point is "the friend who went to Santorini," you'll never be good enough. If your reference point is "the average across human history," you're already a miracle.

Same person, same life, a different coordinate system tells a completely different story.

During my years running my company, I witnessed various "successful people's" anxieties.

A founder with over 100 million in annual revenue was anxious about why it wasn't a billion. A company already serving international clients was anxious about why not bigger international clients. A manager leading a ten-person team was anxious why the adjacent department had thirty people.

Everyone was comparing themselves to the "next level." This comparison ladder has no end—no matter which rung you reach, someone is always above you.

I gradually came to understand that the problem with this ladder isn't "not reaching the top," but "this was never your ladder to begin with."

Kevin Kelly said something I've always remembered: "Don't try to be the best; try to be the only."

The power of this statement lies in how it steps completely out of the comparison framework. When you pursue "the best," you're always comparing to others. When you pursue "the only," you only need to talk to yourself.

---

But "becoming the only" isn't something you can solve with a motivational quote.

It requires you to first answer a deeply uncomfortable question: who exactly are you?

Not your title, not your income, not your social media stats. The thing that remains after you strip away these external labels. What do you care about? What would you spend time on? What activity makes you forget to check your phone?

I spent many years before I started approaching answers to these questions. Seminary training taught me one thing: before you can help others, you must first face yourself. Those years of theological reflection forced me to take apart a lot of self-righteous "sense of mission"—how much was real and how much was just feeding my own vanity.

This disassembly process is painful, but it's also the necessary path to "becoming the only."

---

So this article isn't saying "you're happy enough, stop complaining."

Complaining is okay. Anxiety is normal. Wanting a better life is human nature.

But before you set out to pursue a better life, look down at the ground beneath your feet.

You have clean water to drink. You have stable electricity. You have the freedom to choose. You can read anything you want, including this article.

This isn't "basic." This is a miracle.

Not because you did something extraordinary—but because you happened to be born in this era, in this corner of the world. This luck isn't for bragging about; it's a reminder that you're already standing in a position most people dream of.

From this position, walk the path only you can walk. Not because others are walking it, but because it's yours.
