title: The Life You Envy Is Already Someone Else's Miracle
description: We often develop resentment toward our current circumstances through social media comparisons, forgetting that we already enjoy the "dividends of civilization" like stable electricity, healthcare, and freedom. When we broaden our perspective, the ordinary daily life we possess is actually a miracle that billions of people on Earth dream of. Rather than being anxious about losing at the starting line, we should learn humility and build our own unique path. The world isn't fair, but we can decide what perspective to use when facing it.

## The Life You Envy
### Is Already Someone Else's Miracle

We're always envying others' lives, yet we forget that the days we're living are already miracles in the eyes of others.

#### The Luxury of Civilization's Dividends
Today, your ability to safely browse the internet and enjoy stable electricity and healthcare already far exceeds the daily reality of most people on Earth.
Our frustration over "not being able to afford our dream home" is itself a luxury granted by civilization.

#### The Path to Becoming Unique
Kevin Kelly once said: "Don't try to be the best, try to be the only one."
Rather than being anxious about losing at the starting line, build that path that only you can walk. What's truly valuable is whether you know clearly who you are and how you choose to live.

#### Conclusion
The world isn't fair, but our circumstances are already far better than those of the vast majority of people throughout history.
Your life isn't starting from zero—you're standing on a path that has already been paved. For many people, that path is the miracle itself.
