> The true impact of AI lies not in efficiency gains, but in the rewriting of order.

Past economic systems were built upon human physiological limitations.

We need sleep, we need shifts, we need handovers, we need meetings. The rhythm of all institutional design assumes "humans get tired" as a premise.

Even globalized enterprises cannot truly achieve round-the-clock decision-making. The real bottleneck has never been information, but human physical and cognitive limitations.

But now, an intelligence that requires no rest is entering the decision-making layer.

This is not a tool upgrade. This is a change in civilizational rhythm.

## What is the "Always-On Economy"?

The always-on economy I speak of is not 24-hour operations.

Rather, it is:

> Decision-making, transactions, optimization, and collaboration that can proceed continuously without human presence.

When AI Agents can instantly analyze global inventory and demand, automatically reorganize production and logistics, dynamically adjust pricing strategies, conduct cross-timezone supply chain coordination, and respond instantly in customer service, risk control, and trading—the fundamental rhythm of the economy is compressed.

We transition from a "human-sustained economy" to an "intelligent collaboration economy."

## Structural Change One: Acceleration of Decision Frequency

Traditional enterprise decision-making is intermittent. Meetings, discussions, reports, more meetings. Decisions are nodal events.

But when models begin participating in decisions, decision-making becomes a continuous flow. Instead of quarterly strategy adjustments, there is minute-by-minute automatic optimization.

What does this mean?

**When decision frequency far exceeds human comprehension speed, are humans still in control?** Are we beginning to live in an economy "dynamically calibrated by algorithms"?

## Structural Change Two: Blurring of Organizational Boundaries

AI Agents don't belong to any department. They span finance, supply chain, manufacturing, customer service, and marketing.

In traditional organizations, departments are units of power and responsibility. But in data-flow-driven environments, decisions are the result of cross-module collaboration.

Future enterprises may not be collections of departments, but networks of algorithmic nodes.

This transformation is undermining the logic of traditional management hierarchies. **When organizational structure yields to model structure, power shifts from "position" to "architectural design."**

## Structural Change Three: Transfer of Accountability

When AI participates in decision-making, how is responsibility defined? Is the model responsible? The data? The engineers? Or the enterprise?

In always-on systems, responsibility is no longer clearly identifiable.

This is not a legal problem—this is a civilizational problem. Because the core of civilization lies in traceable responsibility.

**When decisions are made by non-human agents, are we entering a new form of accountability?**

## The Transformation of Human Roles

If AI enters always-on operations, humans won't disappear. But roles will change.

From operators, executors, and sustainers to designers, calibrators, and judges.

Future competitive advantage won't be who can work longer, but who can define order. Not who can use tools, but who can design frameworks.

## Technical Problem or Order Problem?

Current AI discussions often focus on hallucination problems, alignment issues, and employment impacts. But these are surface phenomena.

The deeper question is:

> When efficiency maximization becomes the default goal, are values automatically assumed?

The always-on economy pursues optimization. But civilization must answer: optimization for whom?

Without a value framework, AI will only amplify existing inequities. Without ethical design, automation will only accelerate bias.

## From Tool to Structure

The Industrial Revolution amplified mechanical power. The Digital Revolution amplified information processing power. The AI Revolution amplifies decision-making power.

When decision-making is automated, the economy no longer operates on human rhythm. This is a structural transformation. And all structural transformations ultimately return to civilizational choices.

**Do we have the capacity to maintain "humans" as value subjects while intelligence operates round-the-clock?**

## Civilizational Turning Point

The always-on economy won't ask: "Does this make sense?" It will only ask: "Is this more efficient?"

Therefore, the real question isn't whether AI will replace humans. Rather:

> When intelligence operates round-the-clock, do humans still have the capacity to determine direction?

If we only care about technical performance while ignoring value frameworks, then AI won't destroy civilization. It will only accelerate the chaos we already possess.

Technology enables the economy to operate round-the-clock. Civilization must decide whom it operates for.

Without the capacity for order design, the always-on economy becomes always-on chaos.

AI changes efficiency. But only civilization can determine direction.
