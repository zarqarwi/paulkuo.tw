title: "Super Individual vs Traditional Team: A 12-Day Combat Record"
subtitle: "One person plus one AI, completing the engineering workload of an entire team"
description: "In 12 days, one person working with Claude completed 8 major systems: multilingual website, AIO optimization, social automation, CI/CD pipeline, debate engine, health data analysis. Total cost: NT$3,000, equivalent to 42 person-days, cost efficiency ratio of 117x. This isn't about replacing teams—it's about redefining the minimum unit of a team."

  From February 14-25, 2026, I spent 12 days accomplishing one thing: building a complete personal digital infrastructure from scratch. Multilingual website, AIO optimization, 8-platform social automation, CI/CD pipeline, multi-model debate engine, real-time health data dashboard—all completed by one person plus one AI. Total code volume approximately 23,000 lines, equivalent to 42 person-days, achieving a cost efficiency ratio of 117x. This article isn't about showing off efficiency, but documenting a structural transformation that's happening: when AI becomes cognitive infrastructure, the definition of "team" is being rewritten.

## Using Agent Coding to Write 23,000 Lines of Code in 12 Days

I don't know how to code, yet during Chinese New Year using Claude I completed: a quadrilingual personal website, an eight-platform social auto-posting system, a multi-model debate engine, a real-time health data dashboard, automatic AI cover image generation, a complete CI/CD pipeline, and more.

If outsourced to a traditional team, the quote would be roughly NT$350,000 (at minimum), requiring 3.5 engineers running for 12 days. Not counting my invested time, I spent less than three thousand dollars. This is my Agent Coding record from this year's New Year holiday—an exploration of human-AI collaboration dynamics and producing services that are "What Agent Want."

## My Starting Point

I don't know how to use Terminal. Black screens with white text make me anxious. Python, JavaScript, Astro—these are alien languages to me.

My background is in life sciences and theological training. In my serial entrepreneurship journey, I've worked in Fintech, agricultural e-commerce, served as VP at a construction company, CDO, CMO, and consultant. Digital transformation, circular economy, and Taiwan-Japan exchange cooperation are all within my defense range—all ESG-related. I use Excel but can't write macros. In the past, whenever I needed programming done, I'd either build a team or outsource to third parties.

Mid-month, I transformed a domain I'd owned for N years from a one-page HTML site into a complete content platform. Previously, engineering of this scale would take at least half a year, or three months at the fastest.

## Development Journey

Day one: Claude helped me set up the Astro framework, push to GitHub, and deploy to Cloudflare Pages. I watched it operate throughout, participating in discussions and making decisions when necessary.

Day three: I began understanding what git push does and what frontmatter fields mean. Not because I suddenly learned programming, but because every operation had concrete context—I knew "this line of code is to make article titles display on cards."

Day five: I could directly tell Claude: "The year filter on the Tags page is broken on mobile, there's a problem with the pillar and year combination logic." I didn't know how to fix it, but I knew where the problem was. This distinction is important.

Day seven: I started actively proposing requirements: "I want each article to automatically generate cover images using DALL-E, compressed to under 300KB, automatically uploaded to GitHub." I wasn't learning to code. I was directing a partner who knows how to code.

Day twelve: When the system came online, it automatically fetches Fitbit steps and heart rate, Timing App AI usage hours, and stock price data every 10 minutes, pushes to GitHub triggering auto-deployment. Social posts written in Apple Notes automatically queue in Google Sheets, posting to eight platforms via API. Articles pushed trigger GitHub Actions to automatically translate into English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese.

## Three Things I Learned

**First, the definition of "knowing" has changed.**

Previously, "knowing how to code" meant starting from a blank file and building logic line by line. Now, "knowing" means: you know what problem to solve, you can judge output quality, you can describe problems when errors occur. I still can't write a Python script from scratch. But I can spot where Claude's code has issues, which architectural decisions will create problems later, which CSS segments will break on mobile. This isn't coding ability—it's engineering judgment "intuition." And this ability came from intensive New Year combat experience.

**Second, AI won't replace your judgment, but it will amplify your judgment.**

I cut half of Claude's first draft articles. I overturned its suggested database architecture twice. I sent back its cover images for rework. AI's value isn't in always being right, but in compressing the time from "idea to implementation" from three months to three days. What's compressed isn't quality, but those repetitive, mechanical, automatable steps in between. Judgment remains our responsibility.

**Third, a super individual isn't someone who can do everything, but someone who knows how to orchestrate.**

I used Claude for coding, DALL-E for images, OneUp for scheduling posts, GitHub Actions for automation. I don't "solely use" any single technology. But I know how they can be connected. This feels like leading teams in the past. The difference is that previously I had to manage people's communication, emotions, scheduling, leave requests. Now I collaborate with a partner who doesn't get tired, doesn't take sick days, and helps me debug at 1 AM. The cost difference is 117x.

## Addendum

![42 Equivalent Person-Days, 117x Cost Efficiency Ratio, 1,917 Lines/Day Average Output](/images/articles/super-individual-conclusion.jpg)

This doesn't mean AI can replace all engineers. What I built were personal websites, automation tools, content platforms. These aren't in the same complexity league as banking core systems or semiconductor process software. But that's exactly the point: small to medium projects that previously required a team can now be completed by one person with judgment plus AI. This will change the game rules for freelancers, small entrepreneurs, and personal brand builders.

No need to wait for AGI to arrive. Change is already happening. 42 person-days of work can be completed by one person.

Back to the numbers: 42 person-days of work completed in 12 days with less than three thousand Taiwan dollars. It's not that I'm particularly capable. It's because the tools have changed, and I was willing to jump in and use them.

So you don't need to learn programming first before starting to use AI to get things done. You just need to know what specific problem you want to solve, a bit of patience with errors, and the willingness to change "I can't do this" to "Let me try." AI can't make that decision for us.
