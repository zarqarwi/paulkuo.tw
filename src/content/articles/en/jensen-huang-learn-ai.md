title: "If I Were a Student, I Would Learn AI: The Civilizational Shift Behind Jensen Huang's Simple Statement"
subtitle: "AI literacy is not an elective—it's your fundamental survival language in the new world"
description: "NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly stated in public forums that if he were a student again, his first choice would be to study AI. This statement isn't merely an industry trend forecast—it signals a fundamental shift in educational paradigms: from knowledge memorization to human-AI collaboration, from tool operation to problem design. As AI becomes everyone's collaborator, 'asking good questions' will replace 'knowing answers' as our core competitive advantage."

  Jensen Huang's statement—"If I were a student, I would learn AI"—has gone viral, but most people treat it merely as an industry prediction. Drawing from my experience running SDTI and implementing AI workflows in CircleFlow, I argue this isn't just career advice. It represents a fundamental rebuilding of our cognitive infrastructure: the shift from "what I know" to "what questions I can ask." This article explores the essence of AI literacy and why "knowing how to use AI" is far closer to our future core competency than "knowing how to code."

"If I were a university student right now, I would learn AI."

These words come from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, repeated across multiple public forums between 2024 and 2025. Every time this quote circulates, the comments are remarkably consistent: "Of course he'd say that—he sells GPUs."

But if you extract this statement from the framework of commercial interest and think about it seriously, it's actually speaking to something far more fundamental than "what major to choose."

## From "Knowing Answers" to "Asking Good Questions"

For decades, the core logic of education has been "memory + reproduction." You memorize knowledge from textbooks, correctly reproduce it during exams, and you get good grades, get into good schools, land good jobs. The entire system rewards the accumulation of "pre-existing answers."

Then AI arrived and blew this logic apart.

When ChatGPT can answer in seconds a calculus problem you spent an entire semester learning, when Claude can write you a decent market analysis report, the market value of "knowing answers" is collapsing at a visible rate.

What's replacing it is a different skill: Can you ask a good question?

This isn't metaphorical. It's a concrete technical threshold. Two people using the same AI—one who knows how to decompose problems, provide context, and set constraints, and another who just types "write me a report"—can get outputs that differ in quality by a factor of ten.

When Jensen Huang talks about "learning AI," I don't think he means everyone should learn to code CUDA. He's saying: the ability to collaborate with AI will become the foundation of all abilities.

## Prompt Engineering Isn't a Trick—It's a Thinking Structure

Many people treat "talking to AI" as a technique—learn a few prompt templates, know how to give instructions, and you think you "know how to use AI."

That's as absurd as equating "knowing how to type" with "knowing how to write."

True AI literacy is a reconstruction of thinking structure. You must learn to decompose vague intuitions into precise steps, convert fuzzy requirements into executable commands, and turn that chaotic tangle of thoughts in your head into structured language an AI can understand.

This is actually fundamentally similar to programming. The core of programming isn't syntax—it's logical decomposition. And the core of prompt engineering isn't magic keywords—it's your depth of understanding of the problem itself.

The difference is that programming requires you to learn a machine language, while prompt engineering lets you accomplish something similar using natural language. The barrier to entry is lower, but the demands on thinking quality are actually higher.

## A Lesson I Learned at SDTI

This isn't abstract theory. I've witnessed this shift firsthand through my experience running SDTI and CircleFlow.

In the early days of digital transformation consulting, the most valuable people on our team were "people who knew answers"—people who knew SEO, knew Google Analytics, knew social media marketing. Their value came from the scarcity of specialized knowledge.

But starting in 2023, that logic began to break down. After AI tools became widely available, tasks that previously required specialized knowledge to complete could now be done by a clever intern paired with an AI assistant to 70-80% quality in one-third the time.

This doesn't mean specialized knowledge became unimportant. Quite the opposite—it means "having only specialized knowledge" is no longer enough. You also need to know how to combine your expertise with AI's capabilities to produce results better than either could achieve alone.

I've observed a clear dividing line on my teams: people who adapted quickly aren't necessarily the most technically skilled—they're the "best question askers." They know how to take a vague client need and decompose it into five subtasks they can feed to AI, then reassemble the AI's output into an insightful deliverable.

This kind of ability isn't taught in any university. But it's becoming the [basic operating system for all knowledge work](/articles/code-is-cheap-vibe-coding-to-claws).

## The Time Lag in Educational Systems

The problem is that educational systems react far too slowly to such shifts.

Most university curricula in Taiwan still center on "discipline knowledge transmission." You study accounting and become an accountant; study law and become a lawyer. The entire system assumes "knowledge → licensing → employment" is a stable assembly line.

But when AI can perform basic accounting analysis, legal document summarization, and market research in seconds, that assembly line loses its moat. The gap between a fresh accounting graduate and a non-accounting background worker using AI assistance is rapidly shrinking.

This isn't denying the value of specialized education. It's saying that specialized education needs a new foundation: how to collaborate with AI.

Jensen Huang's recommendation is essentially this: Regardless of your field, AI literacy should be required. Not an elective, not a workshop, not the "digital citizenship" kind of surface-level offering. It should be foundational like English—running through all disciplines from the bottom up.

## Not Just a Tool—It's Cognitive Infrastructure

If you still think of AI as a "better Google," you might be underestimating the scale of what's happening.

Search engines changed how we access information. But AI is changing how we process information. It doesn't just help you find answers—it helps you think, analyze, and [weave scattered threads into meaningful narratives](/articles/canary-in-coal-mine-ai-employment).

This is why I say AI literacy isn't a "tool skill"—it's "cognitive infrastructure." Just as literacy rates transformed how entire civilizations operate, widespread AI literacy will redefine what it means to be capable.

In the past, capable people were "people who knew lots of things."
In the future, capable people will be "people who can mobilize AI to solve complex problems."

The gap between these two kinds of people isn't one of degree—it's one of dimension.

## Your First Step

Back to Jensen Huang's statement: "If I were a student, I would learn AI."

But what if you're no longer a student?

The answer is the same. AI literacy doesn't care about age, major, or what job you do now. It's a skill you can start practicing today.

Not by taking a Python course. By taking the three most time-consuming tasks in your work and trying to decompose them into processes you can collaborate on with AI. Then observe: where does AI outperform you? Where do you outperform AI? Is the combined result better than either could do alone?

That experiment itself is the best way to learn AI.

Because AI literacy's essence was never "learning a tool." It's learning a new way of thinking—weaving your intelligence and machine computation into something greater than the sum of both.

That might be what Jensen Huang sees.
