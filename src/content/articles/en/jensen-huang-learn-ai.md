## If I Were a Student, I Would Learn AI
### Jensen Huang on the Decisive Factors for the Future Workplace

Jensen Huang points out that the decisive factor for the future is knowing how to interact effectively with AI, treating it as an intelligent assistant that helps with thinking.
Interacting with AI is fundamentally about "learning to ask questions." This is a new form of language capability for our times.

The future will no longer focus solely on knowledge retention, but on how you construct problems and collaborate with AI to complete tasks.
Education must shift toward cultivating interactive capabilities, and career preparation must also incorporate AI collaboration skills. AI is the future collaborator and execution assistant.
