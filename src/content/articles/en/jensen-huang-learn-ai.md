## If I Were a Student, I'd Study AI
### Jensen Huang on the Decisive Edge in the Future Workplace

Jensen Huang points out that the decisive advantage of the future lies in knowing how to interact effectively with AI—treating it as an intelligent assistant that aids thinking.
Interacting with AI is, at its core, "learning how to ask questions." This is a new form of language competency for our era.

The future will no longer judge people by memorized knowledge, but by how they structure problems and collaborate with AI to complete tasks.
Education must shift toward cultivating interaction skills, and career preparation must incorporate the ability to work alongside AI. AI is the collaborator and execution partner of the future.
