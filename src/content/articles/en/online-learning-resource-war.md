title: "The Harsh Test of Remote Learning: A Resource War from a Parent's Perspective"
description: "Remote learning during school closures is by no means a lucky break with an extended vacation, but rather a bare-knuckle war of family resource consumption. Online learning cannot easily replace offline physical classes—it severely tests students' self-discipline, parents' logistical support, and families' technological capabilities. Facing this sudden paradigm shift in education, we cannot merely mock or rely on tech tools, but must reconstruct rigorous online learning management mechanisms, because this is a real-world game comparing who has more resources and who packs a bigger punch."

## The Harsh Test of Remote Learning
### A Resource War from a Parent's Perspective

When the Ministry of Education announced the extension of winter break and launched online learning,
some said: "Isn't not having to go to school more relaxing?"

This is truly the most serious misunderstanding of online learning.

### Online Cannot Replace Offline

Adopting online learning for pandemic prevention is a reluctant compromise.
It's not a lucky break, nor is it discovering a superior learning method.

It's like buying tickets to a Mayday concert,
only to have the organizers say: "Watching MVs at home has pretty much the same effect!"

If online could so easily replace offline,
why would Andy Lau cancel over ten concerts, bearing enormous losses?

Those claims that online learning is better than physical learning are complete nonsense.

### A Bare-Knuckle Resource Game

Online learning during the pandemic is a brutal war of resource consumption.

It's a game of mental, physical, and financial expenditure.
A bare-knuckle competition of who has more resources and who packs a bigger punch.

- **Hardware costs:** If your home internet is unstable, it's like diving without an oxygen tank.
- **Space costs:** Home is a place for relaxation. For focus, we even had to rent a co-working space for our child to attend classes.
- **Living costs:** Families without elder support still rely on takeout. When children get sick from bad takeout and miss two days of classes, that's also a hidden cost.

### Parents' Self-Management Strategies

Facing online learning, parents cannot simply dump responsibility on schools and software.
We must establish our own management mechanisms:

1. **Design self-evaluation forms:** Have children daily assess their comprehension, focus, and suitability for video classes.
2. **Require output:** After classes end, require children to write overall reflections in text.
3. **Maintain rhythm:** Strive to maintain regular exercise and diet—often the most difficult part.

### Conclusion

Do not rely on the enemy not coming; rely on having preparations to meet them.

If in the future world, children must spend half their time learning online at home,
parents' attitudes toward education and environmental arrangements must be awakened and prepared early.

This is a great test of willpower.
After going online, those who are weak will only become weaker.
