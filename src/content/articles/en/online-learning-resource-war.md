title: "The Harsh Trial of Continuous Learning During School Closures: A Resource War from Parents' Perspective"
description: "School closures with continuous learning are by no means a windfall of extended vacation, but rather a naked war of family resource consumption. Online learning cannot easily replace offline physical classes—it severely tests students' self-discipline, parents' logistical support, and families' hardware and software capabilities. Facing this sudden educational paradigm shift, we cannot merely mock or rely on technological tools, but must reconstruct rigorous online learning management mechanisms, because this is a realistic game that pits who has more resources and bigger fists."

## The Harsh Trial of Continuous Learning During School Closures
### A Resource War from Parents' Perspective

When the Ministry of Education announced the extension of winter break and launched online learning,
some said: "Isn't it easier not having to go to school?"

This is truly the most serious misunderstanding of online learning.

### Online Cannot Replace Offline

Adopting online learning for pandemic prevention is a reluctant compromise.
It's not stumbling upon a vacation, much less discovering a superior learning method.

It's like buying tickets to a Mayday concert,
only to have the organizers say: "Watching MVs at home has pretty much the same effect!"

If online could so easily replace offline,
why would Andy Lau cancel over ten concerts, bearing enormous losses?

Those claims touting online learning as superior to physical learning are complete nonsense.

### A Naked Resource Game

Online learning during the pandemic is a brutal war of resource consumption.

It's a game of mental, physical, and financial expenditure.
A naked competition of who has more resources and bigger fists.

- **Hardware costs:** If your home internet is unstable, it's like diving without an oxygen tank.
- **Space costs:** Home is a place for relaxation. For focus, we even have to rent separate co-working spaces for children to attend classes.
- **Living costs:** Families without elderly support still rely on takeout. If a child gets sick from bad food and can't attend classes for two days, this is also a hidden cost.

### Parents' Self-Management Strategies

Facing online learning, parents cannot simply dump responsibility on schools and software.
We must establish our own management mechanisms:

1. **Design self-evaluation forms:** Have children daily assess their understanding, focus, and suitability for video classes.
2. **Require output:** After classes end, require children to write overall reflections in text.
3. **Maintain rhythm:** Strive to maintain regular exercise and diet—often the most difficult aspect.

### Conclusion

Do not depend on the enemy not coming; depend on having the means to deal with them.

If the future world requires children to spend half their time learning online at home,
parents' attitudes toward education and environmental arrangements must awaken and prepare early.

This is a great test of willpower.
After going online, the useless will only become more useless.
