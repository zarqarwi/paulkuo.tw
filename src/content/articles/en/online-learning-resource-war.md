title: "The Brutal Test of School Closure Learning: A Resource War from Parents' Perspective"
description: "'School closure doesn't mean learning stops' is far from gaining a long holiday—it's a naked war of family resource consumption. Online learning cannot easily replace offline physical courses; it severely tests students' self-discipline, parents' logistical support, and families' software and hardware capabilities. Facing this sudden educational paradigm shift, we cannot merely mock or rely on technological tools, but must reconstruct rigorous online learning management mechanisms, because this is a reality game that compares who has more resources and whose fist is bigger."

## The Brutal Test of School Closure Learning
### A Resource War from Parents' Perspective

When the Ministry of Education announced the extension of winter break and launched online learning,
some said: "Isn't it more relaxed not having to go to school?"

This is truly the most serious misunderstanding of online learning.

### Online Cannot Replace Offline

Adopting online learning for epidemic prevention is a helpless compromise.
It's not stumbling upon a vacation, much less discovering a better learning method.

It's like buying tickets to a Mayday concert,
only to have the organizers say: "Watching MVs at home has about the same effect!"

If online could so easily replace offline,
why would Andy Lau cancel over ten concerts, bearing enormous losses?

Those claims touting online learning as better than physical learning are complete nonsense.

### A Naked Resource Game

Online learning during the epidemic is a brutal war of resource consumption.

It's a game of mental, physical, and financial expenditure.
A naked competition of who has more resources, whose fist is bigger.

- **Hardware costs:** If your home internet is unstable, it's like diving without an oxygen tank.
- **Space costs:** Home is a place for relaxation. For focus, we even have to rent separate co-working spaces for children to attend classes.
- **Living costs:** Families without elder support still depend on takeout. Once a child gets sick from outside food and can't attend classes for two days, this becomes a hidden cost.

### Parents' Self-Management Strategies

Facing online learning, parents cannot simply throw responsibility to schools and software.
We must establish our own management mechanisms:

1. **Design self-evaluation forms:** Have children daily assess their understanding, focus, and the suitability of video conferencing for courses.
2. **Require output:** After courses end, require children to describe their overall reflections in writing.
3. **Maintain rhythm:** Strive to maintain regular exercise and diet—often the most difficult aspect.

### Conclusion

Do not depend on the enemy not coming; depend on having the means to await them.

If in the future world, children must spend half their time learning online at home,
parents' attitudes toward education and environmental arrangements must awaken and prepare early.

This is a great test of willpower.
After going online, those who were failing will only fail more.
