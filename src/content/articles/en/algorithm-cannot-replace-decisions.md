## The Weight That Algorithms Cannot Replace
### Why We Shouldn't Become Disciples of Scientism?

There's an imagination that goes like this:

If we could analyze all technical patterns, the system could automatically generate buy and sell signals.
If we could analyze users' age and assets, the system could automatically recommend insurance products.

"Systematizing Decision-Making"
This has been the fundamental faith of countless engineering-background startup teams over the past decade or so.

But this is less about logic.
And more about religion.

They are "disciples of scientism."

### The Great Chasm of Decision-Making

From data organization to making decisions is a spectrum process.
The further along, the more ambiguous it becomes.

This involves three types of information:
Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.

Platforms can perfectly handle only structured data.
But starting from semi-structured data, the shadow of decision-making emerges.

Decision-making has never been the sum of data compilation.
It is a subjective leap of thinking.

Disciples of scientism believe that algorithms can bridge this great chasm from semi-structured to unstructured.
In reality, the chasm hasn't narrowed.
It's just that because they "believe," they feel the problem has disappeared.

### The True Role of Information Platforms

Information platforms are "decision support tools."
They cannot, and should not be "decision dependency systems."

Platforms cannot provide you with optimized decision recommendations.
Platforms cannot provide the creativity and intuition needed for business judgment.

If a platform claims it can help you make better decisions and judgments?
Such platforms are either foolish or fraudulent.

### The Essence of Decision-Making is Pain

Information asymmetry has never been life's greatest trouble.
Life's real trouble is: "making decisions."

The ambiguity, ambivalence, and uncertainty in the moment of decision-making
is pain that each person must face alone.

Career choices, trading judgments.
These are all unstructured subjective judgments, carrying the temperature, bias, and arbitrariness of human nature.

There is no mean law.
There is no universal happiness equation.

### Conclusion

Thanks to the fools in this world,
who give fraudsters business to do and grants to write.

We all know AI is evolving toward the unstructured,
but to have systems substitute for decision-making, the costs behind that are staggeringly high.

For entrepreneurs, beyond the faith in algorithmic rationality,
perhaps what we need more is understanding the temperature of human nature and the reality of markets.
