# The Weight Algorithms Cannot Replace
## Why We Shouldn't Become Devotees of Scientism

There's a certain fantasy that goes like this:

If we could analyze every technical chart, the system could automatically generate buy and sell signals.
If we could analyze a user's age and assets, the system could automatically recommend insurance products.

"Systematize the decision-making process"—this has been the foundational creed of countless engineering-minded startup teams over the past decade.

But calling it logic would be generous.
It's closer to religion.

They are devotees of scientism.

## The Vast Chasm of Decision-Making

From data organization to making a decision is a graduated process.
The further along you go, the more ambiguous it becomes.

This process involves three types of information: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.

Platforms can perfectly handle structured data.
But once we enter semi-structured territory, the shadow of decision-making appears.

A decision is never simply the sum of aggregated data.
It is a subjective leap of thinking.

Scientism's devotees believe that algorithms can bridge the vast chasm from semi-structured to unstructured information. In truth, the chasm hasn't narrowed. They simply "believe" it has, so the problem feels like it's disappeared.

## The True Role of Information Platforms

An information platform is a "decision support tool."
It cannot and should not be a "decision dependency system."

Platforms cannot provide you with optimized decision recommendations.
Platforms cannot deliver the creativity and intuition needed for business judgment.

If a platform claims it can help you make better decisions and judgments?
That platform is either foolish or fraudulent.

## The Essence of Decision-Making Is Pain

Information asymmetry has never been life's greatest difficulty.
Life's real challenge is: "making decisions."

The ambiguity, the either-or, the uncertainty at the moment of deciding—these are the pains each person must face alone.

Career choices, trading judgments—these are unstructured, subjective calls, carrying the warmth, bias, and willfulness of human nature.

There is no law of averages.
There is no universal formula for happiness.

## Conclusion

We all know AI is evolving toward handling unstructured data. But having a system make decisions on our behalf comes at a staggeringly high cost.

For entrepreneurs, beyond the faith in algorithmic rationality, perhaps what we need more is an understanding of human warmth and the reality of markets.
