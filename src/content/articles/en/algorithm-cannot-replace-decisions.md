## The Weight Algorithms Cannot Replace
### Why We Shouldn't Become Devotees of Scientism

There's an imagination that goes like this:

If we can analyze all technical patterns, the system can automatically generate buy and sell signals.
If we can analyze users' age and assets, the system can automatically recommend insurance products.

"Systematize decision-making"
This has been the fundamental belief of countless engineering-background startup teams over the past decade.

But this is less logic than it is religion.

They are "devotees of scientism."

### The Great Chasm of Decision-Making

From data organization to making decisions is a spectrum process.
The further along, the more ambiguous it becomes.

This involves three types of information:
Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.

Platforms can perfectly handle only structured data.
But starting with semi-structured data, the shadow of decision-making emerges.

Decision-making has never been the sum of data compilation.
It is a subjective leap of thinking.

Devotees of scientism believe that algorithms can bridge this great chasm from semi-structured to unstructured.
In reality, the chasm hasn't narrowed.
It's just that because they "believe," they feel the problem has disappeared.

### The True Role of Information Platforms

Information platforms are "decision support tools."
They cannot, and should not be "decision dependency systems."

Platforms cannot provide you with optimized decision recommendations.
Platforms cannot provide the creativity and intuition needed for business judgment.

If a platform claims it can help you make better decisions and judgments?
Such platforms are either foolish or fraudulent.

### The Essence of Decision-Making is Pain

Information asymmetry has never been life's greatest frustration.
Life's real frustration is: "making decisions."

The ambiguity, ambivalence, and uncertainty of the moment of decision-making
is pain that each person must face alone.

Career choices, trading judgments.
These are all unstructured subjective judgments, carrying the warmth, bias, and arbitrariness of human nature.

There is no law of averages.
There is no universal formula for happiness.

### Conclusion

Thanks to the fools in this world,
letting fraudsters have business to do and grant proposals to write.

We all know AI is evolving toward unstructured processing,
but to have systems make decisions for us, the cost behind that is staggeringly high.

For entrepreneurs, beyond the faith in algorithmic rationality,
perhaps what we need more is to understand the warmth of human nature and the reality of markets.
