## The Discipline of Slash Careers
### The Other Side of Freedom is Stricter Self-Management

Slash careers are trendy.
But most people only see the appearance of freedom, not the discipline within.

---

### Freedom is a Luxury

Employees have bosses watching, time clocks, and KPIs.
These "shackles" are actually supplies of external order.

When you choose a slash career, all this external order disappears.
You must construct every discipline yourself.

What time do you get up? What do you do today? What are this month's goals?
No one will ask you. Only you.

### Three Levels of Self-Discipline

First level: Time management. Can you start work at a fixed time every day?
Second level: Energy management. Knowing when to sprint and when to rest.
Third level: Attention management. In the flood of information, can you focus on what truly matters?

Most people can't even achieve the first level.

### Conclusion

The barrier to slash careers isn't skill, it's self-discipline.
If you cannot maintain rhythm without external constraints,
then slash careers for you aren't freedom, they're chaos.

Freedom is always the fruit of discipline.
