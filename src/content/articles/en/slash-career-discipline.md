description: "Society often holds stereotypical impressions of 'slash careers' as escapist, fickle, or unprofessional. However, genuine multi-career living is built upon extreme rigor in self-discipline and self-reflection. Before pursuing flexible project-based work, one must first establish three fundamental pillars: building knowledge depth, training professional capabilities, and planning schedules.

## Walking Before Flying
### Debunking the Undisciplined Myths of "Slash Careers"

When "slash careers" are mentioned,
what comes to many people's minds is fickleness, inconsistency, or always looking for something better.

If one cannot meet even the most basic workplace requirement—"doing one thing well"—
how can there be a multi-career life?

### Slash Careers Aren't About Complaining About Work

After reading *The Slash Career*, I discovered that the author demonstrates a high degree of discipline and self-awareness.

The book doesn't discuss how to job-hop or moonlight, nor does it carry the bitter tone of "complaining about office life."
What it truly teaches is how to:
- Build knowledge depth.
- Master systematic thinking methods.
- Practice self-discipline and effective time planning.

The less disciplined people are, the less they understand their own limitations.
They want to do everything, think they can do anything, and ultimately do nothing well.

### Three Cornerstones Before Flight

Slash careers aren't about arguing.
They represent a state of "being able to fly." But before learning to fly, one must first learn to walk properly.

Before embracing flexible work and life, three capabilities must be deeply ingrained:

1. **Building Knowledge Depth:** This is explicit knowledge—statement knowledge accumulated through reading and education.
2. **Training Professional Capabilities:** This is implicit knowledge—practical knowledge accumulated through experience and hands-on work.
3. **Planning Work Schedules:** Understanding the subtle differences between knowledge and expertise enables precise evaluation of resources and time needed for projects.

You can cram through a book in two weeks.
But you cannot lead a team well in two weeks. Teams need time to build relationships, assign tasks, and continuously advance toward higher standards.

### Conclusion

Projects in slash careers are typically knowledge-oriented.
They're not labor-intensive patchwork like driving Uber in the morning, selling coffee in the afternoon, and working night shifts at convenience stores.

Don't mistake slash careers for aimless dabbling—touching this and that without any deep accumulation.

Remember:
- Slash careers are not the opposite of loyalty.
- Slash careers are not the opposite of professionalism.  
- Slash careers are not the opposite of discipline.
