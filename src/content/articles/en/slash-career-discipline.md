title: "Walking Before Flying: Debunking the Myth of Undisciplined 'Slash Careers'"
description: "Society often holds stereotypes about 'slash careers' as escapism from institutions, fickleness, or professional negligence. However, true multi-career living is built upon extremely rigorous self-discipline and self-reflection. Before pursuing flexible project work, one must first establish three foundational elements: building knowledge depth, training professional capabilities, and planning schedules. Slash careers have never been the opposite of loyalty and professionalism; they represent an advanced state of project execution. Before we learn to fly, we must first learn to walk well."

## Walking Before Flying
### Debunking the Myth of Undisciplined "Slash Careers"

When "slash careers" are mentioned,
many people's minds conjure images of fickleness, inconsistency, or always looking for greener pastures.

If one cannot meet the most basic workplace requirement—"doing one thing well"—
where does the multi-career life come from?

### Slash Careers Aren't About Complaining About Work

After reading *The Slash Career*, I discovered that the author demonstrates a high degree of discipline and self-awareness.

The book doesn't discuss how to job-hop or moonlight, nor does it carry the bitter tone of "complaining about office life."
What it truly teaches is how to:
- Build knowledge depth.
- Master systematic thinking methods.
- Practice self-discipline and effective time planning.

The less disciplined people are, the less they understand their own limitations.
They want to do everything, think they can do everything, and ultimately do nothing well.

### Three Cornerstones Before Taking Flight

Slash careers aren't about being argumentative.
They represent a state of "being able to fly." But before learning to fly, one must first learn to walk well.

Before embracing flexible work and life, three capabilities must be deeply ingrained:

1. **Building Knowledge Depth:** This is explicit knowledge—statement knowledge accumulated through reading and learning.
2. **Training Professional Capabilities:** This is implicit knowledge—practical knowledge accumulated through experience and hands-on practice.
3. **Planning Work Schedules:** Understanding the subtle differences between knowledge and expertise enables precise assessment of resources and time required for projects.

You can cram through a book in two weeks.
But you cannot lead a team well in two weeks. Teams need time to build relationships, assign tasks, and continuously advance toward higher standards.

### Conclusion

Projects operated through slash careers are typically knowledge-oriented.
They're not labor-intensive patchwork of driving Uber in the morning, selling coffee in the afternoon, and working convenience store night shifts.

Don't mistake slash careers for being argumentative—dabbling here and there without deep accumulation.

Remember:
- Slash careers are not the opposite of loyalty.
- Slash careers are not the opposite of professionalism.
- Slash careers are not the opposite of discipline.
