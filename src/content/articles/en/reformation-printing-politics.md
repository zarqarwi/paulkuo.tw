## The Real Context of the Reformation
### When Faith Met the Printing Press and Politics

In 1517, Martin Luther posted his Ninety-Five Theses.

The story we're accustomed to goes like this:
A lone hero used truth to fight against the corrupt Roman Curia.

But real history
is never simply a battle of ideas.

It was a perfect storm of technology and politics.

### Technological Amplification and Political Protection

Luther's original intent was merely to challenge the Church hierarchy, seeking academic debate on "indulgences."

But two forces intervened:

First, the rise of the printing press.
Someone translated the theses into German and mass-produced them.
If the theses were a tweet, the printing press was the algorithm that helped it "go viral."

Second, the formation of local nationalism.
Local nobles were already dissatisfied with the Pope, hoping to reclaim governing authority.
Without the political backing of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, Luther would have been burned at the stake long ago.

The Reformation
took shape wrapped in the atmosphere of the printing revolution and power redistribution.

### Indulgences and Crowdfunding

Strictly speaking, Luther never said indulgences were "absolutely wrong."
He simply believed that compared to God's grace, they were insignificant.

Indulgences were essentially the "crowdfunding" of that era.
A monetization model devised by clever minds to raise money for church renovations.

But to make the product sell well, merchants exaggerated its effects.
Like modern health supplements that are hyped up as miracle cures for the sake of sales.

What Luther opposed, many Catholic leaders also opposed.
He never intended to launch a grand reformation, much less split the Church.

### Conclusion

Once the butterfly spreads its wings, the evolution of events becomes uncontrollable.

When we discuss history, we often oversimplify the complexity of how movements arise.

Five hundred years since the Reformation.
Two thousand years of Christianity.

How do we face diversity and unity?
The wisdom has actually been there in the fabric of history all along.
