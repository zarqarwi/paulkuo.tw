## The Contextual Reality of the Reformation
### When Faith Encounters Printing and Politics

In 1517, Martin Luther posted his Ninety-Five Theses.

The story we're accustomed to goes:
A lone hero used truth to confront the corrupt Roman Curia.

But real history
is never simply a battle of ideas.

It was a perfect storm of technology and politics.

### Technological Amplification and Political Protection

Luther's original intention was merely to challenge the Church hierarchy, seeking academic debate on "indulgences."

But two forces intervened:

First, the rise of printing technology.
Someone translated the theses into German and mass-produced them.
If the theses were a tweet, the printing press was the algorithm that helped them "go viral."

Second, the emergence of local nationalism.
Local nobles were already dissatisfied with papal authority, hoping to reclaim governing power.
Without the political backing of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, Luther would have been burned at the stake long ago.

The Reformation
took shape wrapped in the atmosphere of the printing revolution and power redistribution.

### Indulgences and Crowdfunding

Strictly speaking, Luther never claimed indulgences were "absolutely wrong."
He simply believed they were insignificant compared to God's grace.

Indulgences were essentially the "crowdfunding" of that era.
A monetization model devised by clever minds when funds ran short for church reconstruction.

But to make the product sell well, merchants exaggerated its efficacy.
Like modern health supplements that, for the sake of sales, are hyped as miraculous cures.

What Luther opposed, many Catholic leaders also opposed.
He never intended to launch a spectacular reformation, much less split the Church.

### Conclusion

Once a butterfly spreads its wings, the evolution of events becomes uncontrollable.

When discussing history, we often oversimplify the complexity behind the rise of movements.

Five hundred years since the Reformation.
Two thousand years of Christianity.

How do we face plurality and unity?
The wisdom, in fact, has long existed within the context of history.
