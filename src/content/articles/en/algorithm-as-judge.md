# The Cruelty of Quantified Life
## When Algorithms Become the Ultimate Judge

Taking a taxi this morning.  
The driver mustered his courage, turned to me and said:

"Could you please give me five stars? Please."

Because if his rating drops, the system will prioritize dispatching customers to higher-rated drivers.

This is not an isolated case.

## The Underlying Logic of the New Economy

I'm reminded of the story of a delivery worker in China.  
Because a customer gave him a negative review, he broke down crying on the street.  
One negative review could render an entire day's labor worthless.

The new economy has absorbed surplus labor from traditional factories.  
It solved problems of the old society, yet birthed new mechanisms of control.

Less than a century ago.  
People believed there was a ledger of merits in heaven, where deities would reward good and punish evil accordingly.  
That was a rhythm of reckoning once per lifetime.

Now, algorithms achieve weekly, even daily settlements.  
They quantify individual work productivity with precision and cold ruthlessness.

## The Total Expansion of Data

Memes seek embodiment, and data is the new oil.

If labor can be precisely quantified.  
When will the comprehensive measurement of "knowledge productivity," "personal credit," and "physical health" be fully realized?

This is by no means a distant future.

We are already in this wave.  
We are all participating, unknowingly, in this momentous evolution.

Manage your digital footprint with integrity,  
because algorithms are watching you.
