## The Arrogance of Elites and the Path Forward for Youth

Harvard philosophy professor Sandel puts it well:
The biggest problem with the meritocratic system isn't the frustration of those who fail.
It's the arrogance of those who succeed.

When you attribute all your success to your own talent and effort,
you begin to think:
"Others fail because they don't try hard enough."

Once this logic takes hold,
social fracture is not far behind.

### The Winner's Delusion

Which country you're born in, which family,
whether you have access to good education,
whether your body is healthy—
none of these are your choice.

But the meritocratic system encourages you to believe:
you stand here entirely on your own merit.

Sandel calls this the "winner's delusion."
What you think is ability is mostly luck.

### The Unfair Pressure on Youth

Under this system,
young people bear the greatest pressure.

They're told:
if you just work hard enough, you'll succeed.

But the reality is:
Housing prices have risen to levels impossible to catch up with through salaries alone.
Good job opportunities are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few.
"Work hard and you'll succeed" has become the cruelest lie.

### Where Is the Way Forward?

Sandel's answer isn't to overthrow the system,
but to redefine "contribution."

A nurse caring for the elderly,
a worker maintaining roads,
a farmer tending crops—
their contributions to society are no less than those of a Wall Street analyst.

The real way forward
isn't making everyone compete for Harvard.
It's building a society where every job is respected.

### Conclusion

Elite arrogance isn't a personal problem—it's a systemic one.
Only when we begin to acknowledge the role of luck
and start respecting different forms of contribution
can young people see a real path forward.
