## Elite Arrogance and the Path Forward for Youth

Harvard philosophy professor Sandel puts it well:
The biggest problem with the meritocratic system isn't the frustration of those who fail.
It's the arrogance of those who succeed.

When you attribute all your success to your own talent and effort,
you begin to think:
"Others fail because they don't work hard enough."

Once this logic takes hold,
social division isn't far behind.

### The Winner's Illusion

Which country you were born in, which family,
whether you had access to good education,
whether your body is healthy—
none of these were your choice.

But the meritocratic system encourages you to believe:
you're here entirely on your own merit.

Sandel calls this the "winner's illusion."
What you think is ability is mostly luck.

### The Unfair Pressure on Youth

Under this system,
young people bear the greatest pressure.

They're told:
work hard enough, and you'll succeed.

But reality is:
housing prices have risen beyond what salaries can chase.
Good job opportunities are increasingly concentrated among the few.
"Hard work leads to success" has become the cruelest lie.

---

### Where's the Way Forward?

Sandel's answer isn't to overthrow the system,
but to redefine "contribution."

A nurse caring for the elderly,
a worker maintaining roads,
a farmer working the fields—
their contributions to society are no less than those of a Wall Street analyst.

The real way forward
isn't making everyone compete for Harvard.
It's building a society where every job is respected.

### Conclusion

Elite arrogance isn't a personal problem—it's a systemic one.
When we begin to acknowledge the role of luck,
begin to respect different forms of contribution,
only then can young people see a real path forward.
