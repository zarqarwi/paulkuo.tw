## The Arrogance of Elites and the Way Out for Youth

Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel put it well:
The greatest problem with meritocracy isn't the frustration of those who fail.
It's the arrogance of those who succeed.

When you attribute all your success to your own talent and effort, you inevitably begin to think: "Others fail because they didn't try hard enough."

Once that logic takes hold, social fracture isn't far behind.

### The Winner's Illusion

Which country you were born in, which family you belong to, whether you had access to a good education, whether your body is healthy—none of these were your choice.

Yet meritocracy encourages you to believe: you stand here entirely on your own.

Sandel calls this "the winner's illusion." You think it's merit, but most of it is luck.

### The Unfair Burden on Youth

Under this system, young people bear the heaviest pressure.

They're told: if you work hard enough, you'll succeed.

But reality tells a different story: housing prices have risen beyond what salaries can chase. Good job opportunities are concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. "Hard work leads to success" has become the cruelest lie.

### Where Is the Way Out?

Sandel's answer isn't to overturn the system, but to redefine "contribution."

A caregiver who looks after the elderly, a worker who repairs roads, a farmer who grows our food—their contributions to society are no less than those of a Wall Street analyst.

The real way forward isn't making everyone compete for Harvard. It's building a society where every form of work is respected.

### Conclusion

The arrogance of elites isn't a personal problem—it's a systemic one.
When we begin to acknowledge the role of luck and respect different forms of contribution, only then can young people see a real way forward.
