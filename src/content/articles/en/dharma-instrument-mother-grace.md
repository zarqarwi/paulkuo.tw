title: "The Weight the Ritual Instrument Bore for My Mother: Those Extra Six Years Were Both Grace and Farewell"
description: Facing my mother's cancer diagnosis and passing, the shattering of a ritual instrument became a life sign that transcends reason. It reminds us of life's fragility and uncontrollability, teaching us to remain humble before the mysteries of life and death and impermanence. Regret exists not because we didn't do enough, but because love is inherently limited; what we can do is transform this protection beyond understanding into the strength to continue forward for the rest of our lives.

## The Weight the Ritual Instrument Bore for My Mother
### Those Extra Six Years Were Both Grace and Farewell

In 2019, my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung adenocarcinoma.
I brought her a human bone ritual instrument from my Tibetan teacher. The next day, my mother told me: "The ritual instrument has shattered."

#### Grace in the Cracks
A solid ritual instrument shouldn't just shatter like that. Mysteriously, my mother's condition actually improved afterward. Fate seemed to be forcibly split open, creating a narrow crevice that allowed us six more years together as mother and son. Until 2025, when she left this world.

#### Weight Beyond Reason
The ritual instrument bore for her a weight I cannot fathom. Being able to accompany my mother through her remaining years already transcends all the "what ifs."

#### The Limits of Love and Humility
Regret exists because in this mortal world, love is inherently so limited. So profound that even after struggling to hold on for six years, in the end we still cannot bear to let go.
The shattered ritual instrument is a kind of sign: reminding me that life will break; warning me never to be presumptuous; and reminding me that I must continue forward carrying her part of me.

#### Conclusion: Moving Forward Gently in the Unknown
Compassion transcends the forms of religion and the boundaries of reason. Before the mysteries of life and death, these are all signs that "love" leaves behind with all its might. This teaches me to be humble in the unknown, and to transform this protection into the strength to continue forward.
