title: The Weight the Dharma Instrument Bore for My Mother: Those Extra Six Years Were Both Grace and Farewell
description: Facing my mother's cancer and passing, the shattering of a dharma instrument became a life sign that transcends reason. It reminds us of life's fragility and uncontrollability, teaching us to remain humble before the mysteries of life and death and impermanence. Regret comes not from doing too little, but because love itself is inherently limited; what we can do is transform this protection beyond understanding into the strength to continue forward for the rest of our lives.

## The Weight the Dharma Instrument Bore for My Mother
### Those Extra Six Years Were Both Grace and Farewell

In 2019, my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung adenocarcinoma.
I brought her a human bone dharma instrument from my Tibetan master. The next day, my mother told me: "The dharma instrument broke."

#### Grace in the Cracks
A solid dharma instrument doesn't just shatter on its own. Miraculously, my mother's condition actually improved after that. Fate seemed to be forcibly split open, creating a narrow fissure that gave us six more years together as mother and son. Until 2025, when she left this world.

#### Weight Beyond Reason
The dharma instrument bore a weight for her that I cannot fathom. Being able to accompany my mother through her remaining years already transcended all the "what-ifs."

#### The Limits of Love and Humility
Regret exists because in this human world, love is inherently so limited. So profound that even after striving to hold on for six years, I still couldn't bear to let go in the end.
The shattered dharma instrument is a sign: reminding me that life will break; warning me never to be self-righteous; and reminding me that I must continue forward carrying her part of me.

#### Conclusion: Moving Forward Gently in the Unknown
Compassion transcends the forms of religion and the boundaries of reason. Before the mysteries of life and death, these are all signs that "love" leaves behind with all its might. This teaches me to be humble in the unknown, and to transform this protection into the strength to continue forward.
