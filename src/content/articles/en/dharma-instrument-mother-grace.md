title: "The Weight the Dharma Instrument Bore for My Mother: Six Extra Years of Grace and Farewell"
description: "Facing my mother's terminal cancer diagnosis and eventual passing, the shattering of a dharma instrument became a sign that transcends rationality. It reminds us of life's fragility and uncontrollability, teaching humility before the mysteries of life and death. Regret comes not from having done too little, but because love is inherently finite. All we can do is transform this inexplicable protection into the strength to carry on."

# The Weight the Dharma Instrument Bore for My Mother
## Six Extra Years of Grace and Farewell

In 2019, my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung adenocarcinoma.
I brought her a human bone dharma instrument from a Tibetan master. The next day, she told me: "The instrument shattered."

### Grace Through the Cracks
A sturdy dharma instrument doesn't just break on its own. Miraculously, my mother's condition actually improved afterward. It was as if fate had been forced open along a narrow crack, granting us six more years together. In 2025, she left this world.

### A Weight Beyond Reason
What the dharma instrument bore for her was a weight I cannot fathom. Being able to walk with my mother to the end of her life already transcends every "what if."

### The Limits of Love and Humility
Regret exists because, in this world, love is inherently finite. So profound that even after holding on for six years, I still couldn't bear to let go.
The shattered instrument is a mark: reminding me that life will break; warning me never to be self-righteous; and telling me that I must carry her part of the story forward.

### Conclusion: Moving Forward Gently into the Unknown
Compassion transcends the forms of religion and the borders of reason. Before the mysteries of life and death, these are all marks that "love" left behind with everything it had. This teaches me to be humble in the face of the unknown, and to transform this protection into the strength to keep going.
