title: "The Weight the Dharma Instrument Bore for My Mother: Those Extra Six Years Were Both Grace and Farewell"
subtitle: "The hard dharma instrument shattered, the fragile mother recovered—this isn't a miracle story, it's the beginning of my learning humility"
description: "In 2019, my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung adenocarcinoma. I brought a human bone dharma instrument given by a Tibetan master to the hospital. The next day, the instrument shattered, but my mother's condition improved. The following six years were time forcibly stretched open—we walked another stretch of road together in that narrow gap. In 2025, she still left. This article isn't about the supernatural, nor promoting any religion, but recording what a son learned facing life and death: the capacity to love is limited, but precisely because it's limited, you need to give your all while you have it."

  Paul's mother was diagnosed with terminal lung adenocarcinoma in 2019, with doctors offering an unfavorable prognosis. Paul brought a human bone dharma instrument given by a Tibetan Buddhist master to visit his mother. The next day, the instrument shattered, but his mother's condition unexpectedly improved. This experience, inexplicable by reason, became one of the most profound marks in Paul's life. For the next six years, mother and son walked a path that "shouldn't have existed" medically, until his mother's passing in 2025. This isn't a miracle narrative, but a reflection on "what you can still do when facing events beyond understanding."

In autumn 2019, my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung adenocarcinoma.

The doctor spoke professionally, data and terminology one after another. But all I heard in my head was variations of one phrase: there isn't much time left.

On the way home from the hospital, I kept thinking about what to do. Not the kind of "make a list and check off items one by one" doing, but something deeper—in a situation you have absolutely no control over, how much can you really do?

The answer is: almost nothing.

---

I had a human bone dharma instrument given to me by a Tibetan Buddhist master.

Saying "human bone dharma instrument" might make some people uncomfortable, but in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, such instruments have specific religious significance—they're not souvenirs, not amulets, but tools for practitioners. I won't explain Tibetan Buddhist doctrine here because that's not the point of this article. The point is, this instrument held deep meaning for me, and I believed it possessed some power I couldn't fully understand.

Three days after my mother's diagnosis, I brought the instrument to the hospital.

I performed no rituals. No chanting, no prayers. I simply placed it by my mother's bedside.

The next morning, my mother called me, her voice carrying a confusion I'd never heard before: "The dharma instrument broke."

---

I rushed to the hospital. The instrument had indeed shattered.

This object was made of bone, extremely hard. It wasn't glass, wasn't ceramic—it wouldn't just crack from being "placed by the bedside." No one had touched it, it hadn't fallen, there was no external force. It simply broke.

You could call this coincidence. You could say it was material aging. You could offer a hundred rational explanations.

But what happened next made the word "coincidence" increasingly pale.

My mother's condition began to improve. Not the "slightly stable" kind of improvement, but the kind that surprised even the attending physician. Numbers dropped, symptoms eased, the expected trajectory of rapid deterioration was interrupted by something.

I don't know what that "something" was.

---

The following six years were time forcibly stretched open.

My mother's condition fluctuated—not recovery, but not following the initial prognosis either. Every follow-up appointment, every test was like negotiating with a countdown timer—we knew time was limited, but didn't know exactly how much remained.

In those six years, I did things I wouldn't have had the chance to do otherwise.

I accompanied my mother to places she'd always wanted to go. When her physical condition was good, I took her to eat foods she loved. I recorded some videos, preserving her voice and smile. We talked about topics we'd never discussed before—her childhood, her regrets, her expectations for me and my siblings.

These weren't "bucket list" type heroic plans. They were ordinary, trivial moments easily swallowed by daily life. But precisely because I knew this was "extra" time, each day carried a different weight.

It's hard to explain that feeling to someone who hasn't experienced it. You live simultaneously in gratitude and sorrow. Gratitude because you know this time shouldn't have existed; sorrow because you know that no matter how many extra years, you'll still have to say goodbye eventually.

---

In 2025, my mother left.

I won't describe the details of that day. Some things become distorted when written down.

But what I want to say is: even with six years of preparation, even when you "know" this day will come—you're still not ready.

This might be love's most cruel characteristic. It doesn't hurt less because you anticipated the loss. It doesn't stop needing goodbyes because you've already said them.

The shattered dharma instrument, the improved condition, the extra six years—this entire story, I still don't know how to categorize it. It's not a miracle, because "miracle" implies a happy ending, but my mother still passed away. It's not coincidence either, because "coincidence" is too light a word to match those six years' weight.

It's simply an experience I cannot explain. And I choose to continue living with this "inexplicable."

---

I studied many debates about faith and reason in seminary. One camp would say there's no causal relationship between the instrument's shattering and my mother's improvement, that connecting the two is cognitive bias. Another camp would say this was supernatural intervention, evidence of faith.

I stand with neither side.

Not because I don't care about truth, but because regarding this matter, the concept of "truth" might be more complex than we think. I don't need to prove the instrument's shattering "caused" my mother's improvement, nor do I need to deny some connection I can't understand between them.

This "not needing to" isn't avoidance—it's learned.

It was learned at my mother's bedside. It was learned on repeated trips to and from the hospital. It was learned in those 3 AM phone calls that jolted me awake, rushing to the hospital only to find false alarms.

In these moments, your rational framework isn't sufficient. Not that reason is bad, but some experiences exceed reason's jurisdiction.

---

After my mother's passing, that shattered dharma instrument remains on my bookshelf.

Sometimes I look at it, remembering its intact form, remembering that morning it broke, remembering my mother's confused voice on the phone.

It reminds me of three things.

Life breaks. No matter how hard something is, it has its breaking point. Dharma instruments, people, everything you think can be maintained forever—all are like this.

Don't presume to understand everything. I don't know why the instrument broke, I don't know why my mother improved for six years, I don't know why she ultimately left. I don't know. And acknowledging "I don't know" is the most honest response I can give to this experience.

Continue walking with her part of you. My mother gave me not just life, but ways of seeing the world, attitudes toward facing difficulties, the capacity to love. These don't disappear because she left. They're in me, in every article I write, in every choice I make.

The shattered dharma instrument is a marker. What it remembers isn't a miracle—it's the trace left after love gave its all.
