Put on your smart glasses and walk into an old office building. In the projected display, this building is no longer gray concrete—each steel beam is labeled with casting year, material purity, and load-bearing information; every window shows insulation coefficients and replacement needs; the drainage pipes below reveal internal corrosion progress.

What you see is both the building's present and its "mirror"—its complete self in digital space.

You ask the glasses: "How much is this building worth?" Not the real estate price, but the material value. The glasses tell you: what the steel, copper wire, glass, and concrete are worth, and in this year's recycling market, this building "as resources" is worth 8.4 million.

Welcome to the mirror world. When Kevin Kelly mentioned this concept in his 2019 "The Inevitable: 5000 Days," many dismissed it as science fiction.

Now, it's becoming business reality. And its arrival will change all our understanding of manufacturing, governance, resources, and even human meaning.

## Three Information Revolutions

Kevin Kelly uses a concise framework to describe three eras of information technology:

**First revolution: Digitization of information.** Starting in the 1970s, we turned books, music, photos, and text into zeros and ones. The internet, Google, and search engines all served this goal: making information storable, searchable, and shareable. The achievement was clear: any knowledge, once recorded, could be found instantly.

**Second revolution: Digitization of humans.** Starting in 2005, we digitized ourselves—social media, smartwatches, location tracking. Your behavior, location, preferences, and social graph are all recorded, analyzed, and predicted. Facebook knows your mood. YouTube knows your taste. Fitbit knows your health status.

**Third revolution: Digitization of the physical world.** This is just beginning. Its goal is to ensure every object, every space, every system in the physical world has a complete mirror in digital space.

Not just recording existence, but constructing a virtual twin that updates synchronously with the physical world and is highly interactive.

## Four Elements of Mirror World

This revolution requires perfect fusion of four technologies, none dispensable:

**First: Digital twin technology.** Every object is no longer just a serial number, but has a complete parameter set—material, manufacturing date, functional status, usage history, wear progress. This information isn't static, but updates in real-time.

Industrial manufacturing already uses digital twins. A Boeing 787, during flight, has hundreds of sensors transmitting information to the cloud every second, so the digital twin knows engine status, fuel efficiency, and fatigue stress accumulation. But this is just manufacturing.

The current trend is expanding this application to urban infrastructure, buildings, and even individual objects. "Smart cities" aren't just smart lampposts and traffic signals, but digital models of entire cities—digital twins of every street, every building, every water pipe running in real-time.

**Second: AR (Augmented Reality) as interface.** Digital twins alone are useless. If information can only be viewed on computer screens, it's just another application.

What truly changes the game is AR glasses—you look at an object in reality while seeing its digital information overlaid. Future humans' work and life will be completely transformed by this interface. A maintenance worker enters a factory, looks at machines, and glasses tell him in real-time: "This gear is at its 42,000th work cycle, with 8,000 cycles remaining in expected lifespan."

In hospitals, doctors look at patients' bodies while glasses display real-time physiological parameters, medical history, and literature recommendations. In urban planning, mayors look at communities while glasses show population flows, pollution indices, and housing price trends.

**Third: IoT (Internet of Things).** Digital twins are dead without sensors. IoT's goal is: every object needing monitoring has a cheap, long-life sensor.

This sounds simple, but technical challenges are significant. Sensors need power. Batteries eventually need replacement. Only recently have advances in wireless power transmission and ultra-low power sensors made "putting sensors on anything" economically viable.

**Fourth: AI as meaning layer.** Massive sensor information is garbage without AI. AI is needed to: analyze information streams in real-time, predict failures, make recommendations, and automate decisions.

A city's digital twin might have billions of sensor points, generating thousands of TBs of information per second. Humans cannot process it all. But AI can. AI will tell you: "Southern drainage system will overload within three days, recommend activating emergency flow diversion now." Or "A factory in the eastern industrial zone has abnormal carbon quota usage, recommend checking processes."

## The Era of "Mutual Visibility"

Kelly introduces a key concept: **Mutual Visibility.**

Previously, information was unidirectional. Factories could see their production lines, consumers couldn't. Upstream suppliers couldn't see downstream actual demand. Manufacturers couldn't see real failure rates of products in use.

Mirror world changes this. In a true mirror world, entire systems become transparent—not for surveillance, but for optimization.

Product manufacturers can see: when this product easily breaks in real use, why it breaks, how different user groups use it differently. They use this information to improve next-generation design.

Consumers can see: this product's supply chain costs, environmental costs of production processes, and secondary market prices. They can make more informed choices.

City managers can see: real population flows (not statistical models), real pollution sources (not estimates), real infrastructure bottlenecks. They can invest resources precisely.

What's the cost of this transparency? Privacy, new asymmetric relationships, new forms of control. But Kelly isn't describing a utopia—he's describing a reality that's happening.

## CircleFlow: Mirror World Application in Circular Economy

My recent work at CircleFlow is building a specific version of mirror world: **digital twins for urban mining.**

Traditional waste management works like this: garbage comes in, gets sorted, burned or buried, end. Nobody knows how much valuable material is in this waste, or tracks where it ultimately goes.

CircleFlow's vision: every piece of incoming waste has a digital record. Component scanning, value assessment, sorting pathways, recycling targets. When this item is disassembled, materials extracted, and sold to downstream manufacturers, the entire process is recorded on digital twins.

Downstream manufacturers see: the source, purity, and stress characteristics of this batch of recycled steel. They can precisely decide what to make with it.

Eventually, when this steel product is manufactured, sold, used, aged, and discarded, the entire cycle is completely visible on the digital layer.

This isn't just environmental protection. This is an economic revolution. In mirror world, waste is no longer worthless. It has accurate material value, recycling potential, and future costs. Urban mining becomes precision business, not crude waste.

The entire system involves familiar technologies—sensing, AI, data visualization. But when combined, it changes the entire industry's logic.

## What Jobs Does Mirror World Need?

Kelly has a powerful insight: **When mirror world is complete, most of today's jobs will disappear, but the new job types it creates haven't been invented yet.**

Manufacturing workers? Many will be replaced by automation. But "digital twin maintenance specialist" doesn't exist today. This person needs to understand physical systems, digital models, AI logic, and diagnose mismatches between physical failures and digital signals.

"Supply chain transparency analyst"? "Urban metabolism designer"? "Material flow routing optimizer"? These are positions that will emerge in the mirror world era, but today's education system isn't training anyone for them.

In circular economy, we're already encountering this problem. The talent CircleFlow needs must understand waste management, digital systems, and AI. Such talent barely exists in the market, so we're training while doing.

## Risks and Surveillance

Mirror world isn't a gift. Its risks are equally large:

Complete transparency means complete controllability. Once an entire city is digitized, sensored, and AI-monitored, the possibility of power concentration is unprecedented. Authoritarian regimes will love mirror world—every person, every object, every movement is known, predictable, and controllable.

Kelly doesn't avoid this reality. He says: mirror world itself is neutral. It can lead to complete freedom (all information public, power relatively distributed) or complete surveillance. The key is governance architecture, legal frameworks, and who owns and controls this mirror layer.

## The Next Decade

In Kelly's 2025 supplementary article, he mentions that what humans will see in 2049 won't be a perfect mirror world. Rather, a mixed reality—some places hyper-digitized, others still dark, with struggles over power and privacy everywhere.

But the general direction is clear: **Transparency will continue increasing. The boundary between virtual and real will continue blurring. AI's understanding of the physical world will continue deepening.**

In such a future, projects like CircleFlow are just beginning. Not because of their scale, but because they're doing something new—preparing for mirror world's arrival.

Creating new economic logic, new work forms, new ways humans and objects interact.

## Conclusion: Mirror or Prison

Kelly's final question is simple: **What do we do with mirror world?**

Do we use it to optimize cycles, reduce waste, understand complex systems, and improve human life?

Or do we use it to monitor, control, and suppress?

The answer isn't in technology, but in us. Technology is just an amplifier.

The third information revolution has begun. Not in laboratories, but in factories, in cities, in every place needing optimization of complex systems.

Every decision we make now—who can see information, how information is used, how power is distributed—will shape what mirror world becomes.

When you put on glasses to look at this building, you see more than a building's digital twin. You see a future that's completely transparent, completely optimized, and completely controllable.

The question is: Do we want that future?

If not, there's still time to change it. If so, then build it more thoughtfully, ensuring transparency serves freedom, not imprisonment.
