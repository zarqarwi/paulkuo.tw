description: "EQ has been misunderstood as personal cultivation, but its essence is a survival ability that evolved through group interactions. When education overemphasizes individual development, children lose opportunities to compromise and empathize within teams."

## Emotions Are Not Personal
### Why Should EQ Be the Core of Group Education?

Facing tragic incidents of emotional hurt on campus,
we always ask: How are such impulsive and explosive emotional reactions formed?

The answer may lie hidden in our narrow definition of education.

We confine education to intellectual development.
We view education as merely "individual career development."

Yet we forget that humans live in groups.

### The Educational Blind Spot of the Narcissistic Generation

Today's parents often overlook that "making friends" is a skill.

If joining a choir would interfere with tutoring, parents choose to withdraw.
They don't recognize that teaching children to coordinate with others, or even compromise themselves, is a form of learning.

Not being accustomed to having others in one's life—
this indirectly tells children: "Others don't matter, your feelings are paramount."

This may be related to the "Me Generation" that currently dominates parenting discourse.
The private sphere reigns supreme.
They are perhaps the greatest obstacle to promoting group education.

### The Biological Nature of EQ

EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is not a personal matter.
It's not about knowing how to settle your own feelings.

Humans are social animals.
Our DNA is encoded with this: we must interact amicably with others to increase our survival probability.

EQ is a responsiveness cultivated within communities.
It's the ability to conduct oneself within groups.
Not a personality trait developed through solitary meditation.

### Feelings Are Relationships

If we absolutize personal feelings (ME ME ME, I'm the greatest),
there are only two extremes:

Either become a leader with exceptional taste in your field,
or become a recluse whose emotions explode at any moment, wanting to bash heads on the street.

Because feelings are "another way of describing relationships."
Your feelings about yourself involve your relationship with the world.

If you live in a vacuum jar,
if you're accustomed to treating those beneath you as worthless—

One day, this emotion of looking down on others will devour your life.

### Conclusion

If we don't treat this as an educational issue,
then we can only discuss legal preventive measures like "whether buying sulfuric acid should require real-name registration."

But if we agree that this is a responsibility education should bear:

We must teach children to invest themselves in the learning process.
Because when your classmates succeed, you succeed together.
Because you cannot live only in your own world.
