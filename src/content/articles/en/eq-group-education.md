## Emotions Aren't a Private Matter
### Why EQ Should Be the Core of Group Education

When campus tragedies driven by emotional outbursts occur, we always ask: where do these impulsive, explosive emotional reactions come from?

The answer may lie in our narrow definition of education. We reduce education to academics. We treat it as purely "individual career development." Yet we forget that humans live in groups.

### The Blind Spot of the Narcissistic Generation

Today's parents often overlook that making friends is a skill.

If joining a choir interferes with tutoring, the parent will pull the child out. They don't believe that learning to cooperate with others—or even subordinate oneself—is a form of education.

Not being accustomed to having others in your life is an implicit message: "Other people don't matter. Your feelings come first."

This may be connected to the "Me Generation" that now holds the reins of parenting discourse. The private domain is paramount. They are the greatest obstacle to group education.

### The Biological Nature of EQ

EQ isn't a personal affair. Knowing how to manage your own feelings doesn't mean you have emotional intelligence.

Humans are social animals. Our DNA dictates: we must interact cooperatively with others to increase our survival odds.

EQ is a responsiveness cultivated within social groups—the ability to navigate oneself within a community. It is not a personality trait honed through solitary meditation.

### Feelings Are Relationships

If you absolutize personal feelings (ME ME ME), only two extremes remain: either you become a peerless master of taste, or you become someone whose emotions detonate at any moment.

Because feelings are just another word for "relationships." How you feel about yourself is tied to your relationship with the world.

If you live in a vacuum, if you habitually treat anyone less capable as worthless—one day, that contempt will consume your life.

### Conclusion

If we don't treat this as an education problem, we're left debating whether purchasing acid should require ID verification.

But if we agree this is education's responsibility: we must teach children to invest themselves in the learning process. Because when your classmates succeed, you succeed too. Because you simply cannot live in your own world alone.
