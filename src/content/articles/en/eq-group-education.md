description: "EQ is misunderstood as personal cultivation, but its essence is a survival ability evolved through group interaction. When education overemphasizes individual development, children lose opportunities to compromise and empathize within teams."

## Emotions Are Not a Personal Matter
### Why Should EQ Be at the Core of Group Education?

Facing the tragedies of heartbreak in schools,
we always ask: How are these impulsive and explosive emotional reactions caused?

The answer may be hidden in our narrow definition of education.

We confine education to intellectual development.
We view education as merely "individual career development."

But we forget that humans live in groups.

### The Educational Blind Spot of the Narcissistic Generation

Today's parents often overlook that "making friends" is a capability.

If joining a choir interferes with tutoring, parents will choose to quit.
They don't recognize that teaching children to cooperate with others, or even to compromise themselves, is a form of learning.

Not being accustomed to having others in their lives—
this indirectly tells children: "Others don't matter; your feelings come first."

This may be related to the "Me Generation" that currently holds sway over parenting discourse.
The private realm is supreme.
They are the greatest obstacle to promoting group education.

### The Biological Nature of EQ

EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is not a personal matter.
It's not simply knowing how to manage your own feelings that constitutes having EQ.

Humans are social animals.
Our DNA contains this code: we must interact amicably with others to increase our survival probability.

EQ is responsiveness cultivated within communities.
It's the ability to conduct oneself within groups,
not a personality trait developed through solitary meditation.

### Feelings Are Relationships

If we absolutize personal feelings (ME ME ME, I'm the greatest),
there are only two extremes:

Either becoming a domain leader with exceptional taste,
or becoming someone whose emotions explode at any moment, wanting to bash heads on the street.

Because feelings are "another way of describing relationships."
Your feelings about yourself involve your relationship with the world.

If you live in a vacuum jar,
if you're accustomed to treating those inferior to you as worthless—

One day, this emotion of looking down on others will devour your life.

### Conclusion

If we don't treat this as an educational problem,
then we can only discuss legal preventive measures like "whether buying sulfuric acid should require ID registration."

But if we agree that this is a responsibility education should bear:

We must teach children to sacrifice self during the learning process.
Because when your classmates succeed, you succeed together.
Because you cannot live only in your own world.
