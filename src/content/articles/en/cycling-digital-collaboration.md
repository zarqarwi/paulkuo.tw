## Digital Collaboration Through Cycling Tracks
### No Company Can Go It Alone

I went on a ride around the North Coast with friends.
A 62-kilometer route—I turned the workout data into a video.

Taking stock of the resources mobilized behind this video:

- Hardware: iPhone 6S, Garmin Edge 520.
- Software: Garmin, Strava, Relive.
- Cloud resources: YouTube music library, online conversion tools.

This seemingly mundane daily record
actually reveals an extremely profound business reality.

### Cooperation Trumps Competition

The interplay and dialogue between software systems has become incredibly dense.

When Garmin's hardware data can seamlessly feed Strava, then generate 3D video through Relive, this proves one thing:

- No company can handle everything in-house.
- Good partners are absolutely superior to going it alone.

This is a paradigm shift in how work gets done.

Companies in the past only thought about building moats and eliminating competitors.
Today's ecosystems operate differently: make the pie bigger, then serve the market together.

Learn to integrate, learn to open up.
In the digital age, cooperation is the real competitive advantage.
