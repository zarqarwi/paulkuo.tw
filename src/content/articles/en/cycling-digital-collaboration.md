Last month I went on a ride around the North Coast with some friends—62 kilometers. When I got back, I took the sports data and turned it into a 3D trajectory video, which I posted on Facebook. My friends thought it was cool and started asking how I did it.

I started taking stock of everything involved. And I was surprised.

## A Global Supply Chain Behind a Single Video

Hardware side: iPhone 6S handled the photos, Garmin Edge 520 recorded GPS tracks, speed, heart rate, and altitude. Two devices from two different companies—one American, one Taiwanese.

Data transmission: Garmin's data synced via Bluetooth to Garmin Connect in the cloud, then automatically pushed to Strava. The two platforms had API integration, so I didn't need to manually do anything. By the time I'd finished riding and showering, the data was already organized.

Video generation: Strava's data was then read by Relive, which automatically generated a 3D terrain trajectory video. I added free background music from YouTube's music library, converted the file, and I had a professionally-looking video.

From start to finish, I mobilized products and services from at least five multinational enterprises: Apple, Garmin, Strava, Relive, and Google (YouTube). The dialogue between them—through APIs, through standardized data formats, through open integration interfaces—was smoother than my conversation with customer service from any one of them.

Behind a casual cyclist's weekend record lay an entire digital collaboration supply chain.

## The New Definition of Moat

This story is worth writing not because the technology itself is particularly impressive, but because it reveals a profound shift in business logic.

Over the past decade, one of the favorite concepts in business education has been "moat"—what is your core advantage? How much would it cost a competitor to catch up to you? The underlying assumption in this entire framework is: competitive advantage comes from "things others can't do."

But in the world of API economics, the source of competitive advantage is flipping.

Garmin's strength is hardware and sensors. If they wanted to build a community platform themselves, create 3D videos themselves, handle music licensing themselves—those peripheral functions alone could bankrupt their R&D budget. Conversely, Strava doesn't need to make GPS watches, Relive doesn't need to build a community—each company focuses on what it does best, and then connects them all through APIs.

The moat has shifted from "keeping others out" to "bringing others in."

The more you open up, the better you integrate, the more seamless the user experience becomes. And the reason users stay in your ecosystem isn't that they can't leave you—it's that the cost of leaving has become too high, because you've integrated deeply with the other tools in their lives.

## The Transformation Dilemma Seen Through SDTI

In managing SDTI, I deeply felt the harsh reality of this logic.

Many small and medium-sized enterprises in Taiwan still operate with the mindset of "doing everything ourselves." Building their own websites, writing their own ERP, handling their own CRM. Not because they don't know better tools exist, but because "integration" requires more than just technical ability—it requires an [openness of mindset](/articles/digital-transformation-pain).

Many business owners' first reaction when they hear about passing customer data through APIs to third parties is fear: "Will my data be stolen?" "Will they use my customers to do business?" These concerns aren't entirely baseless, but they reflect a zero-sum mentality—what I give you is what I lose.

Companies that truly understand digital collaboration think about something different: the data I give you, after you process it and send it back to me, will have greater value. This is a positive-sum game.

I spent a lot of time explaining this logic to clients. Some understood it, but some ultimately kept their systems closed, doing business alone behind closed doors. The results after a few years are clear: those willing to integrate mostly survived and are doing better than before; those who insisted on doing everything themselves—many have already been eliminated by the market.

## Collaboration Isn't a Virtue, It's Efficiency

I want to emphasize something: collaboration in the digital age isn't a "moral choice," nor is it some utopian vision of "shared prosperity." It's cold, hard efficiency calculation.

How many people, how much money, how much time does it take for a company to build a complete user experience from scratch? If that experience can be assembled in two weeks by integrating three existing services, then "doing it ourselves" isn't just slow—it's wasteful.

That's why the most successful companies today are often not those doing everything, but those best at "assembling." Apple doesn't manufacture memory, but it assembles the world's best phones. Shopify doesn't do logistics, but it integrates the best e-commerce experience.

Assembly capability is the core competitiveness of a new era.

And the prerequisite for assembly is openness. You must be willing to expose part of yourself to your partners, and you must trust that they'll expose their best parts to you. This requires not technology, but perspective.

## Lessons from a 62-Kilometer Ride

Back to that 62-kilometer video.

I'm not actually that great of a cyclist. That day's average pace was around 22 kilometers per hour, with only a few hundred meters of elevation gain. But because of that mundane ride, with an entire [transnational digital ecosystem silently at work](/articles/traffic-beyond-currency), it became a professionally-looking piece of content.

That's the power of collaboration. It doesn't make the strong stronger—it lets ordinary people produce extraordinary things.

If you're an entrepreneur, ask yourself one question: among the things you're currently spending the most resources on, which ones don't actually need to be done by you? Which ones could be completed through integrating existing services?

Learn to open up. Learn to integrate. In this era, collaboration isn't a bonus—it's the price of entry.
