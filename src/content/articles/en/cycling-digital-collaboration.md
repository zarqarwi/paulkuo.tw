## Digital Collaboration Through Cycling Tracks
### No Company Can Go It Alone

I went on a ride around the North Coast with friends.
A 62-kilometer route, and I turned the exercise data into a video.

Let me inventory the resources behind this video:

- Hardware: iPhone 6S, Garmin Edge 520.
- Software: Garmin, Strava, Relive.
- Cloud resources: YouTube music library, online conversion tools.

This seemingly mundane daily record
actually reveals an extremely profound business reality.

### Cooperation Beats Competition

The interplay and dialogue between software has become incredibly dense.

When Garmin's hardware data can seamlessly feed into Strava, then generate 3D videos through Relive, this proves one thing:

- No company can do everything by itself.
- Good partners are absolutely stronger than going it alone.

This is a paradigm shift in how work gets done.

Companies used to focus only on building moats and eliminating competitors.
Today's ecosystems operate differently: make the pie bigger, then serve the market together.

Learn to integrate, learn to be open.
In the digital age, cooperation is the real competitive advantage.
