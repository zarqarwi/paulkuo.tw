## Digital Collaboration Through Cycling Data
### No Company Can Go It Alone

Went on a cycling trip around the North Coast with friends.
A 62-kilometer route—I turned the exercise data into a video.

Let me inventory the resources that went into this video:

- Hardware: iPhone 6S, Garmin Edge 520
- Software: Garmin, Strava, Relive
- Cloud resources: YouTube music library, online conversion tools

This seemingly ordinary daily record
actually reveals an extremely profound business reality.

### Cooperation Beats Competition

The interplay and dialogue between software systems has become incredibly sophisticated.

When Garmin hardware data seamlessly feeds into Strava, then generates 3D video through Relive, this proves one thing:

- No company can build everything from scratch alone.
- Good partners absolutely beat going it alone.

This is a paradigm shift in how work gets done.

Companies used to focus solely on building moats and eliminating competitors.
Today's ecosystems operate differently: make the pie bigger, then serve the market together.

Learn to integrate, learn to open up.
In the digital age, cooperation is the real competitive advantage.
