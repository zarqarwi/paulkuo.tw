title: "Moral Man and Immoral Society: Why Good People Do Bad Things When They're Together"
subtitle: "Individual conscience is fragile, institutional selfishness is powerful—this is a mandatory lesson for every participant in society"
description: "Niebuhr's observation from 1932 remains sharp today: individuals can have moral sensibilities, but groups—corporations, nations, political parties—behave almost inevitably selfishly. Not because there are too many bad people, but because institutional logic is more powerful than individual conscience. Understanding this gap is the first step toward facing social reality, and the beginning point for meaningful change."
abstract: |
  Reinhold Niebuhr's 1932 classic reads like a well-aimed blow even today. Paul approaches it from dual experience in entrepreneurship and church, discovering that Niebuhr's insights apply not only to state politics but also to corporate organizations and religious communities. A good person entering a bad system doesn't change the system—the system changes the person. This article explores why "hiring good people" doesn't solve structural problems, and what else we can do.

Years ago, a friend who worked as a middle manager at a large corporation had dinner with me. He's a good person—kind to family and friends, actively involved in charitable work. But that day he told me something that left me silent for a long time.

His company decided to lay off an entire department. Thirty-some people. He was responsible for executing it. "I know some of them have difficult financial situations at home," he said, "but the company's bottom line just can't sustain it. What can I do?"

He wasn't a bad person. But the organization he represented made a decision that was brutal for thirty-some families.

This is what Niebuhr saw through nine decades ago.

## A Book from 1932

Reinhold Niebuhr was one of the most important American theologians of the twentieth century. In 1932, he published *Moral Man and Immoral Society*. The book's central argument is simple enough to be summarized in one sentence:

Individuals can have conscience, but groups are almost inevitably selfish.

Why? Because when people form groups—corporations, nations, political parties, churches—the logic of decision-making shifts from "what is right" to "what benefits us." Not because groups lack good people, but because the structural interests of groups systematically override individual moral judgment.

When you alone encounter an injured stranger, your conscience says "help them." But when you represent a company facing suppliers, your role says "cut costs." You personally might think excess packaging is wasteful, but representing the marketing department, you say "packaging is brand experience."

It's not that you've changed. It's that your position has changed. And position redefines your moral coordinates.

## Structural Sin

In theological language, this is called "structural sin."

Traditional views of sin focus on the individual: a person lies, steals, hurts others—that's their sin. But Niebuhr points to a more subtle, more massive form of sin—one that doesn't exist in any single person, but rather in institutions and structures.

Every manager in a sweatshop might be a "normal" person. They wouldn't kick a dog on the street or yell at a server. But the factory's operational logic—pursuing minimum costs and maximum output—leads them collectively to make decisions that exploit workers.

The problem is, you can't find one "bad person" to blame. Because everyone is just "doing their job." The sin isn't in any individual—it's in the structure.

This hit me hard. Because the training I received in seminary focused heavily on "personal sin and redemption." But Niebuhr showed me that if you only address the individual level, you never reach the things that cause large-scale harm.

## What I Saw at SDTI

During my time running SDTI, Niebuhr's observations were repeatedly confirmed.

When helping clients with digital transformation, I often encountered this situation: everyone in the company knew the current approach was problematic, but no one dared say so. Because speaking up is seen as "causing trouble," and while the existing approach is inefficient, at least it doesn't threaten anyone's job.

This is the group's self-interested logic at work. It's not that no one sees the problem—it's that the system's structure makes "maintaining status quo" align better with everyone's individual interest than "driving change."

I once pointed out directly in a senior management meeting that one of their processes was wasting resources. The room fell silent for about ten seconds. Then a vice president spoke: "We all know, but this process involves budget allocations across three departments."

Translation: untouchable. Because touching this process means touching the power structure. And [the inertia of power structures](/articles/digital-transformation-pain) is far more powerful than any individual's will for reform.

## Good People Can't Fix Bad Systems

Niebuhr's greatest insight for me is this: you cannot solve institutional problems by "hiring good people."

Every election in Taiwan, everyone searches for "good candidates." Find someone with a good image and good reputation, and people think we're saved. But Niebuhr would tell you: when a good person enters a bad system, the most likely outcome isn't that the good person changes the system—it's that the system changes the good person.

Not because the good person lacks will. But because systemic pressure is omnidirectional, continuous, and sustained by powerful incentive structures. Asking someone to resist an entire institution's inertia through individual willpower alone is simply unfair.

What truly changes society isn't more good people. It's better systems—ones with checks and balances, transparency, and accountability mechanisms.

This doesn't sound romantic. But Niebuhr was never a romantic. He was a realist—a realist grounded in faith.

## The Church Is No Exception

If you think "collective immorality" only happens in business and politics, you probably haven't looked closely at churches.

I spent many years in church circles and observed a heartbreaking pattern: when churches face internal problems—sexual harassment, financial opacity, abuse of power—their first response isn't to face the problem but to protect the organization. "Don't let the outside world know." "We'll handle it internally." "We must preserve the church's witness."

This is identical to how corporations handle scandals. The group's instinct for self-preservation doesn't automatically disappear just because the group claims to "belong to God."

Niebuhr, as a theologian, was especially clear-eyed about this. He never believed that religious groups would automatically be more moral than secular ones. He believed that [religious groups lacking checks and balances](/articles/fundamentalist-faith-arrogance) could be even more dangerous—because they use "God's will" to justify group selfishness.

## Clarity Isn't Surrender

So is Niebuhr a pessimist?

No. He's a "clear-eyed actor."

His message isn't "human nature is too flawed, give up." It's "human nature has its limits, so we need something better than naïveté." That something better is systems—thoughtfully designed, self-correcting systems.

What does this mean for individuals?

First, abandon the "good people fantasy." Don't assume that finding a good leader, a good pastor, a good boss solves problems. Ask instead: does this organization have checks and balances? Does it have channels for wrongdoing to be exposed?

Second, focus on structure. Many social problems that look like "individual character" issues are actually [institutional design problems](/articles/canary-in-coal-mine-ai-employment). Low wages aren't because young people don't work hard enough—they're because the labor market structure is broken. Overwork isn't because employees don't know how to rest—it's because corporate culture and performance systems encourage it.

Third, stay uncomfortable. Reading Niebuhr doesn't make you feel good. But that discomfort is necessary. Because only discomfort drives you to do something.

Moral people in immoral societies don't automatically produce moral results. But a clear-eyed person at least knows where the problem lies.

And knowing where the problem lies is the first step toward change.
