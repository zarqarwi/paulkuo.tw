description: "Niebuhr offered a sharp observation: individuals can be moral, but groups are often immoral. Corporations, nations, organizations—when people gather in groups, the logic of self-interest overwhelms the voice of conscience. Understanding this is the first step toward facing social reality."

## Moral Individuals, Immoral Society

Reinhold Niebuhr wrote "Moral Man and Immoral Society" in 1932.
Reading it today, it remains unsettlingly sharp.

His core argument is simple:
Individuals can possess conscience, empathy, and morality.
But when people form groups—nations, corporations, political parties—
the behavior of these groups is almost inevitably selfish.

### Why Are Groups More Selfish?

When an individual faces another person,
conscience speaks.
You see someone hurt, you want to help.

But when you make decisions representing an organization,
your considerations change.

You have to think about: shareholder interests, votes, market share.
Personal moral sense gets diluted by the logic of group interests.

### A Corporate Example

A company's CEO might be a good person.
He donates to charities, cares about employee health.

But when the company faces cost pressures,
he will still lay off workers, squeeze supplier prices, externalize pollution.

Not because he's bad.
But because institutional logic is more powerful than personal conscience.

### The First Step Toward Facing Reality

Niebuhr wasn't a pessimist.
He was just more honest than most.

He tells us:
Don't naively believe that good people automatically create good society.
You need good institutions, good checks and balances, good laws.

Because when power concentrates,
even the best people get corrupted.

### Conclusion

Understanding "group immorality" isn't about giving up.
It's about staying clear-eyed.

Only by seeing reality clearly
can we make meaningful changes within that reality.
