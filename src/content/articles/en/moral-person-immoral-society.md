Corporations, nations, organizations — when people gather into collectives, the logic of self-interest overwhelms the voice of conscience. Understanding this is the first step toward facing social reality."

# Moral Man, Immoral Society

In 1932, Reinhold Niebuhr wrote *Moral Man and Immoral Society*. Reading it today, it remains uncomfortably sharp.

His core observation is simple: Individuals can have conscience, empathy, and morality. But when people form groups — nations, corporations, political parties — the group's behavior is almost inevitably selfish.

## Why Are Groups More Selfish?

When an individual faces another person, conscience speaks. You see someone hurt, and you want to help.

But when you make decisions on behalf of an organization, your considerations change. You must think about: shareholder interests, votes, market share. Individual moral sense gets diluted by the group's logic of interest.

## The Corporate Example

A company's CEO might be a wonderful person. They donate to charity and care about employee health.

But when the company faces cost pressures, they will still lay off workers, squeeze supplier prices, and externalize pollution.

Not because they're bad. But because the logic of the system is stronger than individual conscience.

## The First Step in Facing Reality

Niebuhr was not a pessimist. He was simply more honest than most.

He tells us: Don't naively assume that good people can build a good society. You need good institutions, good checks and balances, good laws.

Because when power concentrates, even the best people will be corrupted.

## Conclusion

Understanding "the immorality of groups" is not about giving up. It's about seeing clearly.

Only by seeing reality clearly can we make meaningful change within it.
