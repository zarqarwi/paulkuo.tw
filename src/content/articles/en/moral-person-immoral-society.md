title: "Moral Persons, Immoral Society: Why Good People Do Bad Things When They Come Together"
subtitle: "Personal conscience is fragile, institutional selfishness is powerful—this is a lesson every social being must learn"
description: "In 1932, Niebuhr made an observation that remains cutting today: individuals can possess moral sensibility, but groups—corporations, nations, political parties—almost inevitably behave selfishly. This isn't because there are too many bad people, but because the logic of institutions is more powerful than individual conscience. Understanding this gap is the first step toward facing social reality, and the starting point for driving meaningful change."
abstract: |
  Reinhold Niebuhr's 1932 classic work still reads like a devastating blow today. Drawing from dual experience in entrepreneurship and church, Paul discovers that Niebuhr's insights apply not only to national politics, but also to corporate organizations and religious groups. When a good person enters a bad system, they won't change the system—the system will change them. This article explores why "getting good people to do it" doesn't solve structural problems, and what else we can do.

A few years ago, a friend who works as a middle manager at a large corporation had dinner with me. He's a genuinely good person—good to his family, good to his friends, passionate about social causes. But that day he told me something that left me silent for a long time.

His company had decided to eliminate an entire department. Over thirty people. He was responsible for executing the decision. "I know several of them are in difficult financial situations at home," he said, "but the company's financials just can't support it. What can I do?"

He wasn't a bad person. But the organization he represented made a decision that was cruel to over thirty families.

This is exactly what Niebuhr saw through over ninety years ago.

## A Book from 1932

Reinhold Niebuhr was one of the most important American theologians of the twentieth century. In 1932, he published *Moral Man and Immoral Society*. The book's core argument is simple enough to summarize in one sentence:

Individuals can possess conscience, but groups are almost inevitably selfish.

Why? Because when people form groups—corporations, nations, political parties, churches—the logic of decision-making shifts from "what is right" to "what benefits us." Not because there aren't good people in the group, but because the group's interest structure systematically overrides individual moral judgment.

When you as an individual encounter an injured stranger, your conscience says "help them." But when you represent a company dealing with suppliers, your role says "reduce costs." You as an individual might think excessive packaging is wasteful, but when you represent the marketing department, you'll say "packaging is brand experience."

It's not that you've changed. It's that your position has changed. And position redefines your moral coordinates.

## Structural Sin

In theological language, this is called "structural sin."

Traditional concepts of sin focus on the individual: a person lies, steals, or harms others—that's their sin. But Niebuhr identified a more hidden, more massive kind of sin—one that doesn't exist in any individual person, but exists within institutions and structures.

Every manager at a sweatshop might be a "normal" person. They wouldn't kick dogs on the street or yell at waitstaff. But the factory's operational logic—pursuing lowest costs and highest productivity—leads them to collectively make decisions that exploit workers.

The problem is, you can't find a single "bad person" to blame. Because everyone is just "doing their job." The sin isn't in any individual—the sin is in the structure.

This perspective deeply impacted me. Because my seminary training heavily focused on "individual sin and redemption." But Niebuhr showed me that if you only address the individual level, you'll never touch the things that truly cause large-scale harm.

## What I Saw in Companies

During my experience running companies, Niebuhr's observations were repeatedly validated.

When helping clients with digital transformation, I often encountered this scenario: everyone in the company knew the current approach was problematic, but no one dared speak up. Because those who raised issues would be seen as "troublemakers," while existing practices, though inefficient, at least wouldn't cost anyone their job.

This is the group's self-interested logic at work. It's not that no one sees the problems—it's that the institutional structure makes "maintaining the status quo" more aligned with everyone's personal interests than "driving change."

I once directly pointed out in a client's executive meeting that one of their processes was wasting resources. The room fell silent for about ten seconds. Then a VP spoke up: "We all know, but this process involves budget allocation across three departments."

Translation: untouchable. Because touching this process would disturb the power structure. And the inertia of [power structures](/articles/digital-transformation-pain) is far more powerful than any individual's reform will.

## Good People Can't Fix Bad Systems

Niebuhr's greatest insight for me was this: you can't solve institutional problems by "finding good people."

Every election cycle in Taiwan, everyone searches for "good candidates." Find someone with a good image and good reputation, and feel like there's hope. But Niebuhr would tell you: when a good person enters a bad system, the most likely outcome isn't that the good person changes the system, but that the system changes the good person.

Not because good people lack resolve. But because the system's pressure is comprehensive, continuous, and backed by powerful incentive structures. Asking someone to rely on personal willpower to fight against an entire system's inertia is fundamentally unfair.

What can truly change society isn't more good people. It's better institutions—institutions with checks and balances, transparency, and accountability mechanisms.

This doesn't sound romantic. But Niebuhr was never a romanticist. He was a realist—a realist with theological depth.

## Churches Are No Exception

If you think "group immorality" only happens in corporations and politics, you might not have carefully observed churches.

Having spent many years in church circles, I've observed a heartbreaking pattern: many churches, when handling internal problems—sexual harassment, financial opacity, abuse of power—first react not by facing the problem, but by protecting the organization. "Don't let outsiders know," "We'll handle it internally," "We must consider the church's witness."

This follows exactly the same logic as corporations handling scandals. A group's self-preservation instinct doesn't automatically disappear because the group claims to be "of God."

Niebuhr, as a theologian, was particularly clear-eyed about this. He never believed religious groups would automatically be more moral than secular ones. He believed that [religious groups lacking accountability mechanisms](/articles/fundamentalist-faith-arrogance) could even be more dangerous—because they would use "God's will" to rationalize group selfishness.

## Being Clear-Eyed Isn't Giving Up

So was Niebuhr a pessimist?

No. He was a "clear-eyed actor."

His message wasn't "human nature is too corrupt, give up." It was "human nature has its limitations, so we need something better than naivety." That something better is institutions—thoughtfully designed institutions with self-correcting capabilities.

What does this mean for individuals?

First, stop the "good people fantasy." Don't think that finding a good leader, a good pastor, a good boss solves everything. Ask instead: Does this organization have accountability mechanisms? Are there channels for exposing wrongdoing?

Second, focus on structures. Many social problems that appear to be "individual character" issues are actually [institutional design problems](/articles/canary-in-coal-mine-ai-employment). Low wages aren't because young people don't work hard enough—it's because the labor market structure has problems. Overwork isn't because employees don't know how to rest—it's because corporate culture and performance systems incentivize overwork.

Third, stay uncomfortable. Reading Niebuhr's book won't make you feel comfortable. But that discomfort is necessary. Because only discomfort drives you to do something.

Moral persons, in an immoral society, don't automatically produce moral outcomes. But a clear-eyed person at least knows where the problem lies.

And knowing where the problem lies is the first step toward change.
