description: "Niebuhr offered a sharp observation: individuals can be moral, but groups tend to be immoral. Corporations, nations, organizations—when people gather in groups, the logic of self-interest overwhelms the voice of conscience. Understanding this is the first step in facing social reality."

## Moral Individuals, Immoral Society

Reinhold Niebuhr wrote "Moral Man and Immoral Society" in 1932.
Reading it today, it remains unsettlingly sharp.

His core insight is simple:
Individuals can have conscience, empathy, and morality.
But when people form groups—nations, corporations, political parties—
group behavior is almost inevitably selfish.

### Why Are Groups More Selfish?

When an individual faces another person,
conscience speaks.
You see someone injured, you want to help.

But when you make decisions representing an organization,
your considerations change.

You have to think about: shareholder interests, votes, market share.
Personal moral sensibilities get diluted by the logic of group interests.

### A Corporate Example

A company's CEO might be a good person.
He donates to charity, cares about employee health.

But when the company faces cost pressures,
he will still lay off workers, squeeze supplier prices, externalize pollution.

Not because he's bad.
But because institutional logic is more powerful than personal conscience.

### The First Step in Facing Reality

Niebuhr wasn't a pessimist.
He was just more honest than most.

He tells us:
Don't naively think good people automatically create good society.
You need good institutions, good checks and balances, good laws.

Because when power concentrates,
even good people get corrupted.

### Conclusion

Understanding "group immorality" isn't about giving up.
It's about staying clear-eyed.

Only by seeing reality clearly
can we make meaningful change within that reality.
