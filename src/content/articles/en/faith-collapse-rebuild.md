## The Collapse and Reconstruction of Faith
### Understanding Religion's Essence Through the 1995 Intercalary Eighth Month Prophecy

The world is cruel.  
To continue believing in a loving God in the face of a cruel world requires tremendous depth.

Yet many choose a shortcut:  
They close their eyes.

Accepting that "the world is about to end" is the simplest faith choice.  
It eliminates the need for thinking.  
It removes dialogue.  
It even gives people a sense of spiritual superiority.

I call this "instant noodle faith."  
Simple, fast, yet utterly without nutrition.

### The Cost of Prophetic Farce

In 1995, the Taiwan Strait crisis erupted.  
Church circles were frantically spreading prophecies of "Communist China's bloody massacre of Taiwan."

Some believed deeply.  
They fled, emigrated, abandoned lifelong savings, escaping the land that had nurtured them.

The result?  
In 1999, those pastors who had propagated the message simply brushed it off with "God has His own good intentions."  
And those believers could only return to Taiwan quietly and tragically, caught between loan sharks and survival.

One mistaken teaching  
can completely sever faith from life.

Are all religious people good people?  
The world has never worked that way.

### Theology's True Task

If knowledge is dead,  
if believers' level remains only at the pale statement of "believe in Jesus and receive eternal life,"

then the life they see is merely a plane without history, without accumulation.

Facing the intricate complexities of existential reality,  
we need a body of knowledge that possesses both traditional wisdom and the ability to offer direction.

This is theology's task.

Theology is not a tool.  
Theology is reflection within faith.  
It must keep pace with the times; it must be dynamic systematic thinking.

### Conclusion

Facing natural disasters and tragedies (like the Tainan earthquake),  
using language like "homosexuality brings judgment" for faith propaganda is utterly terrible nonsense.

Why does God allow tragedies to happen? We don't know.  
But we know He wants people to do justice and love mercy.

Open your eyes to see the real world.  
Faith was never meant to be escapist monasticism that distances us from humanity.
