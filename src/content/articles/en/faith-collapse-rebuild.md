## The Collapse and Reconstruction of Faith
### Understanding the Nature of Religion Through the 1995 Leap August Prophecy

The world is cruel.
Facing a cruel world and continuing to believe in a loving God requires tremendous depth.

But many people choose a shortcut:
They close their eyes.

Accepting that "the world is about to end" is the simplest faith choice.
It eliminates the need for thinking.
It removes dialogue.
It even gives people a sense of spiritual superiority.

I call it "instant noodle faith."
Simple, fast, but utterly without nutrition.

### The Cost of Prophetic Farce

In 1995, the Taiwan Strait Crisis erupted.
Church circles frantically spread prophecies of "Communist China's bloody massacre of Taiwan."

Some believed deeply.
They fled—emigrating, abandoning life savings, escaping the land that had nurtured them.

The result?
In 1999, the pastors who had promoted these messages simply brushed it off with "God has His good intentions."
Meanwhile, those believers could only return to Taiwan quietly and miserably, trapped between gangster debt collectors and survival.

One false teaching
can completely sever a person's faith from life.

Are all religious people good people?
The world has never operated that way.

### The True Task of Theology

If knowledge is dead,
if believers' understanding stops at the pale statement of "believe in Jesus and receive eternal life,"

then the life they see is merely a flat surface without history or accumulation.

Facing the complex realities of existence,
we need knowledge that contains both traditional wisdom and directional guidance.

This is the task of "theology."

Theology is not a tool.
Theology is reflection within faith.
It must keep pace with the times; it must be dynamic systematic thinking.

### Conclusion

When facing natural disasters and suffering (such as the Tainan earthquake),
using language like "homosexuality brings judgment" for faith propaganda is utterly terrible nonsense.

Why does God allow tragedies to happen? We don't know.
But we know He hopes people will act justly and love mercy.

Open your eyes and see the real world.
Faith should never be escapist isolationism that distances itself from humanity.
