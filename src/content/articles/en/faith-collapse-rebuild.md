The 1995 prophecy debacle revealed that when believers abandon thinking and act on blind obedience alone, faith and life become completely severed. True theology isn't a ticket to heaven—it's dynamic thinking refined in the real world."

# The Collapse and Rebuilding of Faith
## Lessons from the 1995 Leap Month Prophecy

The world is cruel.
To continue believing in a loving God in the face of that cruelty requires enormous depth.

But many choose a shortcut: closing their eyes.

Accepting that "the world is about to end" is the simplest choice of faith. It eliminates the need for thinking and dialogue. It even provides a sense of spiritual superiority.

I call it "instant-noodle faith." Simple, fast, and utterly devoid of nourishment.

## The Cost of the Prophecy Debacle

In 1995, the Taiwan Strait Crisis erupted. Church circles were flooded with prophecies that "China would slaughter Taiwan."

Some believed without question. They abandoned their savings, fled the land that raised them.

The result? By 1999, the pastors who had pushed this message brushed it off with a single phrase: "God has His own purposes." Meanwhile, the believers could only return to Taiwan in misery, crushed between debt collectors and survival.

A single erroneous teaching can completely sever faith from life.

## The True Task of Theology

If knowledge is dead—if believers remain at the pale declaration of "believe in Jesus and gain eternal life"—then their view of life is a flat plane without history or depth.

Facing the complexity of existence, we need a body of knowledge that carries traditional wisdom yet points toward direction. That is the task of theology.

Theology isn't a tool. It's the reflective practice within faith. It must evolve with the times. It must be dynamic systems thinking.

## Conclusion

Using language like "homosexuality brought God's judgment" as faith propaganda in the face of natural disasters is utter nonsense.

Why does God allow tragedy? We don't know. But we know He wants people to act justly and love mercy. Open your eyes to the real world. Faith was never meant to be escapism from humanity.
