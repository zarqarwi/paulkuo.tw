## The Collapse and Reconstruction of Faith
### Understanding Religion Through the 1995 Leap Eighth Month Prophecy

The world is cruel.  
To continue believing in a loving God in the face of a cruel world requires tremendous depth.

But many choose a shortcut:  
Close your eyes.

Accepting that "the world is about to end" is the simplest faith choice.  
It eliminates the need for thinking.  
It removes dialogue.  
It even grants one a sense of spiritual superiority.

I call this "instant noodle faith."  
Simple, fast, but utterly without nutrition.

### The Cost of Prophetic Farce

In 1995, the Taiwan Strait crisis erupted.  
Church circles were flooded with prophecies of "Communist China's bloodbath of Taiwan."

Some believed wholeheartedly.  
They fled overseas, emigrated, abandoned their life savings, and escaped the land that had nurtured them.

The result?  
In 1999, those pastors who had promoted these messages simply brushed it off with "God has His own good purposes."  
Those believers could only return to Taiwan silently and miserably, caught between gangster debt collectors and the struggle for survival.

A single false teaching  
can completely sever one's faith from life.

Are all religious people good people?  
The world has never operated that way.

### The True Task of Theology

If knowledge is dead,  
if believers' understanding only reaches the pale statement of "believe in Jesus and receive eternal life,"

then the life they perceive is merely a flat plane without history or accumulation.

Facing the complex realities of existence,  
we need a body of knowledge that both carries traditional wisdom and provides direction.

This is the task of "theology."

Theology is not a tool.  
Theology is reflection within faith.  
It must keep pace with the times; it must be dynamic systematic thinking.

### Conclusion

In the face of natural disasters and trauma (such as the Tainan earthquake),  
using language like "homosexuality brings judgment" for faith promotion is absolutely terrible nonsense.

Why does God allow tragedy to happen? We don't know.  
But we know He wants people to act justly and love mercy.

Open your eyes to see the real world.  
Faith should never be escapist isolationism that withdraws from humanity.
