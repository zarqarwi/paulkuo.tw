title: "Riding the Wave or Drowning? The Historical Turning Point We're Living Through"
subtitle: "From the internet revolution to global lockdowns, our generation's 'firsts' are more thrilling—and more brutal—than any history textbook"
description: "In early 2020, Australian wildfires had been burning for half a year, COVID-19 spread from Wuhan to the world, and the Tokyo Olympics faced the first pandemic-related postponement in history. Looking back from the future, we'll realize we stood at a massive turning point. The question isn't whether the wave will come—the wave has already arrived. The question is: are you riding the wave, or are you drowning? This article was written in February 2020, when the pandemic was just beginning and everything remained unclear. Yet certain insights remain valid six years later: in times of great change, agility survives better than size."
abstract: |
  Paul wrote this observation in February 2020—when COVID-19 was just beginning to spread globally and everything was still filled with uncertainty. From the internet revolution to climate disasters to global lockdowns, our generation has personally witnessed more "firsts in history" than perhaps any previous generation. When familiar order collapsed within weeks, the first to fall were the largest, most rigid organizations. Our team's survival experience during the pandemic confirmed this point—lightweight, liquid teams that could rapidly reorganize proved more reliable than any five-year plan. This isn't prophecy, but a real-time record from someone standing at the crest of the wave.

This article was written on February 20, 2020.

I mention this date first because timing matters here. In February 2020, COVID-19 had already spread from Wuhan, but most countries worldwide were still watching and waiting. Taiwan was beginning to heighten its vigilance, the mask rationing system had just launched, but people on the streets were still commuting normally, working normally, still thinking "it probably won't be too serious."

No one knew what would happen next.

But if you're willing to step back and view the immediate chaos within a larger framework, you'll see something that makes your skin crawl: we're standing at a massive historical turning point, and most people haven't realized it yet.

Let's take inventory of the "firsts" our generation has experienced.

We personally lived through the rise of the internet, watching it transform the landscape of nearly every industry within twenty years. From an era without mobile phones to an era where everyone carries a smartphone—this transformation is so dramatic it has no precedent in human history.

We personally felt the cruelty of climate change. The Australian bushfires that began in late 2019 burned for nearly half a year, destroying over 18 million hectares—roughly half the size of Japan. This wasn't distant news, but real-time images you saw on social media: skies turned orange, animals fleeing for their lives.

We witnessed a city of ten million people being completely locked down. On January 23, 2020, Wuhan was sealed off, with approximately 11 million people prohibited from leaving. Land, sea, and air transport were comprehensively controlled. This wasn't a movie, not a drill.

We faced the prospect of Olympics being canceled due to pandemic—looking back, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were indeed postponed to 2021, becoming the first modern Olympics delayed due to pandemic.

We saw global medical resource runs, massive business failures, schools completely shifting to online learning—each one "unprecedented."

These aren't movie plots. This is the reality we're breathing.

Looking back from the future, history textbooks might mark this period as the "Great Rupture" or "Great Reorganization." Like how later generations view the period from 1914-1945—two world wars, the Great Depression, complete collapse and rebuilding of order—what we're experiencing might be another level of civilizational turning point.

But we're inside it, unable to see the full picture. Like a fish in the ocean that can't sense "waves"—it only knows water is moving, sometimes pushed forward, sometimes pulled down.

That was my feeling in early 2020. Not panic, but a strange lucidity—sensing that many things I thought were solid were actually loosening, and the pandemic just accelerated that loosening to a visible degree.

Our experience in the early pandemic gave me very concrete understanding of this "loosening."

We're not a big company. Small team, few clients, relatively tight operational cost control. But even so, when the pandemic hit, the impact was direct and swift. Face-to-face workshops couldn't proceed, several confirmed projects were suspended, second-quarter revenue projections had to be rewritten.

But I observed something interesting: among our clients, the first to struggle weren't the smallest companies, but the largest ones.

Those organizations with massive physical operations, extensive fixed assets, and rigid processes responded slowest when the giant wave hit. Because to change course, they first had to hold countless meetings; to hold meetings, they first had to find all stakeholders; to find stakeholders, they first had to confirm decision-making processes. By the time decisions emerged, the wave had already passed.

Conversely, lightweight, flexible teams with elastic asset allocation could redeploy within days. We ourselves did this—transitioning all services online within two weeks, not because we had foresight, but because we were small enough, light enough that the cost of pivoting was low.

This isn't bragging about small company advantages. It's making a more fundamental observation: in environments of massive change, large physical operations aren't assets—they're liabilities.

I later used a metaphor to understand this: in calm weather, big ships are more stable than small boats. But when tsunamis come, when big ships capsize, they're done, while small boats might actually ride the waves and survive.

This metaphor isn't perfect, but it points to a core insight: in drastically changing environments, the key to survival isn't being "bigger," but being "lighter."

Asset lightweighting. This isn't just financial strategy—it's survival strategy.

It means: don't lock all your resources into single forms, single locations, single assumptions. Maintain liquidity. Maintain your ability to reconfigure at any time.

For businesses, this means flexible team structures, remote-capable work models, revenue sources not dependent on single clients or single markets.

For individuals, this means skill diversity, income diversity, mental flexibility. Don't bind your identity to a single business card—because that card could disappear at any time.

I wrote this article in February 2020. At that time, I didn't yet know how long the pandemic would last or how deep the impact would be. I only knew one thing: what we were experiencing wasn't temporary disruption, but structural transformation.

Looking back six years later, this judgment wasn't wrong.

The pandemic changed work patterns, consumption models, educational methods, and international relations. Some changes were reversed after the pandemic ended, but more changes are irreversible. Remote work won't completely disappear, online education won't return to zero, global supply chain reorganization continues.

The great wave has already hit. But the sea won't return to calm.

---

So the question isn't "will the wave come"—waves will always come.

The question is: are you riding the wave, or are you drowning?

This depends on whether you made yourself light enough before the wave arrived. Being light enough doesn't mean "wanting nothing," but "not being weighed down by what you own." Your assets, your titles, your plans—when giant waves hit, are these flotation devices that help you rise, or lead weights that pull you down?

This might be the most important survival question of our era.
