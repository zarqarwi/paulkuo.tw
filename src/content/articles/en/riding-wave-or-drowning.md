title: "Riding the Wave or Drowning? The Historical Turning Point We're Living Through"
description: "From the internet revolution to climate change, to the pandemic lockdowns sweeping the globe, our generation is being thrust onto the cutting edge of a great historical epoch. As familiar order collapses, massive physical assets will become burdens that drag down survival. Facing unprecedented upheaval, the only survival rule is 'asset lightweighting'—maintaining liquid fluidity and freedom to avoid drowning in the waves of world reconstruction."

## Riding the Wave or Drowning?
### The Historical Turning Point We're Living Through

What would it feel like to view the present from the future?

We suddenly realize
that we are standing on the wave of a great historical epoch.

### Unprecedented Epochal Changes

Taking inventory of the "firsts" we've personally experienced:

- Personally witnessing the rise of the internet, transforming the landscape of all industries.
- Personally feeling the cruelty of climate change (such as Australia's forest fires burning for six months).
- Encountering a virus resembling a biological weapon sweeping the globe, with death tolls rapidly climbing.
- First time witnessing cities of ten million people completely locked down, with comprehensive land, sea, and air controls.
- First time facing the possibility of Olympic Games being canceled due to pandemic.
- First time confronting global medical resource shortages and massive corporate bankruptcies.
- First time having students engage in large-scale online learning.

These are not movie plots.
This is the reality we are breathing.

### The Liquid Survival Rule

In such a turbulent environment, the old rules have become obsolete.

Massive physical establishments and rigid organizations
will only become lead weights accelerating the sinking when giant waves strike.

The key to future survival lies in:
- Asset lightweighting
- The more liquid, the more free

This may be a world war without gunpowder.
On top of the wave, or drowning beneath it?
This depends on the speed of our transformation.
