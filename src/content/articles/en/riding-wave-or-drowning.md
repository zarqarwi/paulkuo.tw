title: "Riding the Wave or Drowning? The Historical Turning Point We Are Living Through"
description: "From the internet revolution to climate change, to the global pandemic lockdowns sweeping the world, our generation is being thrust onto the cutting edge of a great historical era. As familiar orders collapse, massive physical assets will become burdens that drag down survival. Facing unknown upheavals, the only survival rule is 'asset lightweightness'—maintaining liquid fluidity and freedom to avoid drowning in the waves of world reconstruction."

## Riding the Wave or Drowning?
### The Historical Turning Point We Are Living Through

What would it feel like to view the present from the future?

We suddenly realize
that we are standing on the waves of a great historical era.

### Unprecedented Era of Massive Change

Taking stock of the "firsts" we have personally experienced:

- Personally experiencing the rise of the internet, transforming the face of all industries.
- Personally feeling the brutality of climate change (such as Australia's forest fires burning for half a year).
- Encountering virus-like biological weapons sweeping the globe, with death tolls rapidly climbing.
- First time witnessing cities of ten million people completely locked down, with comprehensive land, sea, and air controls.
- First time facing the possible cancellation of the Olympics due to epidemic.
- First time confronting global medical resource shortages and massive corporate bankruptcies.
- First time having students engage in large-scale online learning.

These are not movie plots.
This is the reality we are breathing.

### The Laws of Liquid Survival

In such a turbulent environment, the old rules have already failed.

Massive physical establishments and rigid organizations
will only become lead weights accelerating the sinking when giant waves hit.

The key to future survival lies in:
- Asset lightweightness
- The more liquid, the more free

This may be a smokeless world war.
Riding the wave, or drowning beneath it?
This depends on the speed of our transformation.
