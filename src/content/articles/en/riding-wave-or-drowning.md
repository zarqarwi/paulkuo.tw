title: "Riding the Wave or Drowning? The Historical Turning Point We're Living Through"
description: "From the internet revolution to climate change, and the global pandemic lockdowns that swept the world, our generation is being thrust to the forefront of a great historical epoch. As familiar order collapses, massive physical assets will become burdens that drag down survival. Facing unknown upheavals, the only survival principle is 'asset lightweighting' — maintaining liquid fluidity and freedom to avoid drowning in the tide of world reconstruction."

## Riding the Wave or Drowning?
### The Historical Turning Point We're Living Through

What would it feel like to view the present from the future?

We suddenly realize
that we're actually standing atop the waves of a great historical epoch.

### Unprecedented Era of Massive Change

Taking stock of the "firsts" we've personally witnessed:

- Personally experiencing the rise of the internet, transforming the landscape of every industry.
- Personally feeling the brutality of climate change (such as Australia's forest fires burning for half a year).
- Encountering a virus like a biological weapon sweeping across the globe, with death tolls rapidly climbing.
- First time witnessing cities of ten million people completely locked down, with comprehensive land, sea, and air controls.
- First time facing the possibility of Olympic Games being canceled due to pandemic.
- First time confronting global medical resource shortages and massive corporate bankruptcies.
- First time having students engage in large-scale online learning.

These are not movie plots.
This is the reality we're breathing.

### Liquid Survival Principles

In such a turbulent environment, the old rules have become obsolete.

Massive physical structures and rigid organizations
will only become lead weights accelerating the sinking when giant waves hit.

The key to future survival lies in:
- Asset lightweighting
- The more liquid, the more free

This may be a world war without gunpowder smoke.
Riding atop the waves, or drowning beneath them?
This depends on the speed of our transformation.
