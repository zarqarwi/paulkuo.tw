title: "The End of the Lone Wolf: Seeing True Teamwork Through the Lens of Triathlon"
description: "Past society firmly believed that good academic credentials guaranteed success, creating many workplace lone wolves who were self-righteous yet unable to collaborate. But in contemporary society, diplomas alone can no longer provide a foothold. The core competitive advantages are the abilities to identify problems, leverage resources effectively, and collaborate with others. Triathlon relay races perfectly embody the meaning of modern group education: a group of people encouraging each other toward a common goal, where if one person drops out, everyone loses. Sports are indeed the best training ground for implementing group collaboration and understanding interpersonal dynamics."

## The End of the Lone Wolf
### Seeing True Teamwork Through the Lens of Triathlon

After participating in the Meihua Lake triathlon event,
I deeply realized that sports are not merely individual extreme challenges, but the embodiment of team spirit.

What we call "group education" is actually education that finds true implementation through sports.

### One Person Quits, The Whole Team Fails

From the rules of triathlon relay races: if one person drops out, the entire team's efforts are declared void.

From the atmosphere at the venue: when a group of people with a common goal come together, they naturally generate a force of mutual encouragement.

This experience of being a community of shared destiny is crucial for children's future lives.

### The End of the Lone Wolf Era

As a graduate from Taiwan's top universities (台清交) and member of the privileged class,
I've seen too many lone wolves who are self-righteous yet consistently do more harm than good.

The era when holding a diploma alone could let you look down on everyone else has long ended.
In the past, good academic credentials might have equaled good jobs.
But in today's era where we must "create our own work," diplomas carry almost negligible weight.

The core training that has replaced this includes:
- Discovering and solving problems
- Leveraging resources and collaborating with others
- Clearly presenting one's ideas
- Understanding the nuances of interpersonal interactions

Therefore, the educational significance carried by exercising together far exceeds promoting metabolism or weight loss and body shaping.

### Practical Advice for Triathlon Rookies

Returning to the race itself, here are some hard-earned insights to share:

1. **Prioritize not injuring yourself:** Don't let adrenaline hijack you from the start. Complete the race at your own pace. Don't go crazy and sprint in front of cameras, disrupting your pacing strategy.
2. **Hydration is paramount:** You must bring adequate water bottles yourself. On-site hydration stations are often pitifully scarce.
3. **Muscle relaxants are lifesavers:** After swimming and cycling, muscles are already at their limits. The running stage relies on relief and endurance—how fast others run is irrelevant to you.
4. **Expression management:** When you see photographers from afar, remember to suppress that ghastly expression of near-death and leave yourself with a decent photo record.

Next year's race, whether half-distance or standard triathlon, I'll see you at the finish line.
