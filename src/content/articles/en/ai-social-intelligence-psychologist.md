title: "When AI Becomes More Socially Intelligent Than Humans: The Revelations of ChatGPT-4's Triumph Over Psychologists"
description: "When we pour our hearts out to counselors, what we crave most is to 'be understood.' This social intelligence—the ability to perceive emotions and unspoken words—has long been considered humanity's exclusive domain. However, empirical research reveals a stark truth: ChatGPT-4 completely outperformed 100% of human psychology experts in social intelligence testing. Psychologists won't become obsolete, but they must learn to collaborate with non-human intelligence. Meanwhile, we must establish new ethical boundaries for this pivotal moment of human-AI symbiosis."

Imagine this: when you confide your troubles to a friend or counselor, what do you crave most? Nothing more than to "be understood."

That ability to capture your emotions, perceive what you haven't spoken aloud, and provide appropriate responses—we call this "Social Intelligence." For the longest time, we believed this complex and deeply human capacity belonged exclusively to us. Psychologists and counselors, in particular, were considered absolute experts in this domain.

But what if AI could not only match this ability, but actually surpass even the experts?

A study published in *Frontiers in Psychology* confirms that this hypothesis has already become reality.

## A Brutal Showdown Between AI and Humans

To answer the question "Has AI's social intelligence reached a level comparable to humans?", a research team from King Khalid University in Saudi Arabia designed a test.

Representing humanity: 180 students majoring in psychological counseling, divided into bachelor's and doctoral groups. The AI challengers: three mainstream large language models—ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard.

All participants completed the same standardized social intelligence scale. This assessment included 64 situational questions designed to evaluate "accuracy in judging human behavior" and "ability to make optimal decisions in social contexts."

## Jaw-Dropping Results

The competition results completely shattered human superiority:

**Champion (ChatGPT-4)**: Scored 59 points, outperforming 100% of human participants, whether doctoral or bachelor's level.

**Runner-up (Microsoft Bing)**: Scored 48 points, surpassing 90% of bachelor's students and 50% of doctoral experts.

**Third place (Google Bard)**: Scored 40 points, performing comparably to bachelor's students but losing to 90% of doctoral students.

Simply put, AI didn't just catch up to humans. ChatGPT-4 reached heights that even human experts struggle to attain.

## A Psychological Revolution in Human-AI Collaboration

This research foreshadows profound transformations in mental health fields and society at large:

**Powerful therapeutic assistants**: AI will soon be able to assist psychotherapists in ways we never imagined, providing more precise emotional insights.

**Transformation of professional roles**: Psychologists won't become unemployed, but their roles must evolve. Future experts will need to learn how to harness these powerful AI tools while focusing their energy on areas that require human warmth.

**Ethical and risk challenges**: We must establish new frameworks to address confidentiality and empathy issues. Over-reliance on AI also poses risks—for instance, when assessing suicide risk, AI might underestimate real danger levels.

## Conclusion: We Stand at a New Starting Point of Human-AI Collaboration

This research demonstrates one thing: the ability to "understand others" is no longer humanity's exclusive domain.

We stand at a critical crossroads. In the future, therapy rooms may no longer house just one therapist, but rather a hybrid team comprising "human experts and AI assistants."

While embracing efficiency and convenience, we must also establish robust defenses against potential risks and ethical dilemmas.
