title: "When AI Becomes More Socially Intelligent Than Humans: The Social Intelligence Revelation of ChatGPT-4's Triumph Over Psychologists"
description: "When we confide in counselors, what we most crave is to 'be understood.' For ages, this social intelligence—the ability to perceive emotions and unspoken words—has been considered humanity's exclusive domain. However, empirical research reveals a harsh truth: ChatGPT-4 completely outperformed 100% of human psychology experts in social intelligence tests. In the future, psychologists won't become obsolete, but they must learn to collaborate with non-human intelligence; and we must establish new defenses for this ethical turning point of human-AI symbiosis."

Imagine when you're confiding your troubles to a friend or counselor—what do you most desire? Nothing more than to "be understood."

That ability to capture your emotions, perceive what you haven't said aloud, and provide appropriate responses—we call this "Social Intelligence." For ages, we've believed this complex and deeply human capacity belongs exclusively to humanity. Particularly psychologists and counselors—they are the absolute experts in this domain.

But what if AI can not only achieve this, but even do it better than the experts?

A study published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychology* has confirmed that this hypothesis has already become reality.

## A Brutal Showdown Between AI and Humans

To answer the question "Has AI's social intelligence reached a level comparable to humans?", a research team from King Khalid University in Saudi Arabia designed a test.

Human representatives: 180 students majoring in psychological counseling, divided into bachelor's and doctoral groups. AI challengers: Three mainstream large language models—ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard.

All participants completed the same standardized social intelligence scale. This scale contains 64 situational questions designed to assess individuals' "accuracy in judging human behavior" and "ability to make optimal decisions in social situations."

## Jaw-Dropping Competition Results

The competition results completely shattered human superiority:

**Champion (ChatGPT-4)**: Scored 59 points, outperforming 100% of human participants, whether doctoral or bachelor's level.

**Runner-up (Microsoft Bing)**: Scored 48 points, surpassing 90% of bachelor's level students and 50% of doctoral level experts.

**Third place (Google Bard)**: Scored 40 points, performing at the level of bachelor's students but losing to 90% of doctoral students.

Simply put, AI hasn't just caught up with humans. ChatGPT-4 has even reached heights that human experts find difficult to attain.

## A Psychology Revolution Through Human-AI Collaboration

This research heralds profound transformations in the mental health field and society at large:

**Powerful therapeutic assistants**: AI will be able to assist psychotherapists in ways we never imagined, providing more precise emotional insights.

**Transformation of professional roles**: Psychologists won't become unemployed because of this, but their roles must evolve. Future experts will need to learn to harness these powerful AI tools and focus their energy on areas that require more human warmth.

**Ethical and risk challenges**: We must establish new norms to address confidentiality and empathy issues. Over-reliance on AI also poses risks—for instance, when assessing suicide risk, AI might underestimate real danger levels.

## Conclusion: We Stand at a New Starting Point of Human-AI Collaboration

This research demonstrates one thing: the ability to "understand others" is no longer humanity's exclusive domain.

We stand at a critical crossroads. In the future, therapy rooms may no longer contain just one therapist, but rather a hybrid team composed of "human experts and AI assistants."

While embracing efficiency and convenience, we must also establish solid defenses against potential risks and ethical issues.
