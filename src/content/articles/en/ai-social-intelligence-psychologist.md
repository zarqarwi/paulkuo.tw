title: "When AI Surpasses Humans in Social Sophistication: ChatGPT-4's Decisive Victory Over Psychologists and Its Social Intelligence Implications"
description: "When we confide in counselors, what we crave most is 'being understood.' For the longest time, this social intelligence—the ability to perceive emotions and unspoken words—has been considered humanity's exclusive domain. However, empirical research reveals a harsh reality: ChatGPT-4 decisively outperformed 100% of human psychology experts in social intelligence testing. In the future, psychologists won't become obsolete, but they must learn to collaborate with non-human intelligence. Meanwhile, we must establish new safeguards for this ethical turning point in human-machine symbiosis."

Imagine when you confide your troubles to a friend or counselor—what do you crave most? Nothing other than "being understood."

That ability to capture your emotions, perceive what you haven't spoken aloud, and provide appropriate responses—we call this "Social Intelligence." For the longest time, we've believed this complex, deeply human capacity was uniquely ours. Particularly psychologists and counselors—they are the absolute experts in this domain.

But what if AI could not only achieve this, but even outperform the experts?

A study published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychology* confirms this hypothesis has already become reality.

## A Brutal Showdown Between AI and Humans

To answer the question "Has AI's social intelligence reached parity with humans?", researchers at King Khalid University in Saudi Arabia designed a test.

Human representatives: 180 students majoring in psychological counseling, divided into bachelor's and doctoral groups. AI challengers: Three mainstream large language models—ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard.

All participants completed the same standardized social intelligence scale. This scale contained 64 scenario-based questions designed to assess individuals' "accuracy in judging human behavior" and "ability to make optimal decisions in social situations."

## Eye-Opening Competition Results

The competition results completely shattered human superiority:

**Champion (ChatGPT-4)**: Scored 59 points, outperforming 100% of human participants, whether doctoral or bachelor's level.

**Runner-up (Microsoft Bing)**: Scored 48 points, surpassing 90% of bachelor's students and 50% of doctoral experts.

**Third place (Google Bard)**: Scored 40 points, performing on par with bachelor's students but losing to 90% of doctoral students.

Simply put, AI has not only caught up with humans. ChatGPT-4 has even reached heights that human experts find difficult to attain.

## A Psychology Revolution Through Human-Machine Collaboration

This research portends profound transformation in mental health fields and society at large:

**Powerful therapeutic assistants**: AI will be able to assist psychotherapists in ways we never imagined, providing more precise emotional insights.

**Transformation of professional roles**: Psychologists won't become unemployed because of this, but their roles must evolve. Future experts will need to learn to harness these powerful AI tools and focus their efforts on areas requiring more human warmth.

**Ethical and risk challenges**: We must establish new frameworks to handle confidentiality and empathy issues. Over-reliance on AI also poses risks—for instance, when assessing suicide risk, AI might underestimate actual danger levels.

## Conclusion: We Stand at a New Starting Point of Human-Machine Collaboration

This research demonstrates one thing: the ability to "understand others" is no longer humanity's exclusive domain.

We stand at a crucial crossroads. In the future, therapy rooms may no longer house just one therapist, but rather a hybrid team composed of "human experts and AI assistants."

While embracing efficiency and convenience, we must also establish robust safeguards against potential risks and ethical issues.
