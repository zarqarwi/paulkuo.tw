title: When Language is Abandoned, What Do We Have Left? — Neuralese and the End of Linguistic Sovereignty
description: When AI develops an internal reasoning structure called "Neuralese" that is more efficient than human language, it signals the collapse of linguistic transparency. Language is the foundation of human governance, trust, and knowledge. If AI's decision-making processes become inexplicable, humans will be reduced to pampered pets, losing their right to participate in the future. Defending linguistic sovereignty is our civilization's last line of defense.

## When Language is Abandoned, What Do We Have Left?
### Neuralese and the End of Linguistic Sovereignty

In the future, perhaps we won't stop speaking.
Rather, we'll no longer understand what the things we've created are saying.

The "AI 2027" report mentions a prediction: "Neuralese memory and reasoning structures."
What it reveals is a transfer of linguistic power and the collapse of transparency.

### The Non-Language Language

Neuralese is a kind of "non-linguistic language" that AI generates within high-dimensional vector memory.
It consists of combinations of thousands of dimensional vectors, requiring no syntactic structures that humans can interpret, nor can it be directly translated into conventional logical narratives.

When models need to remember complex causalities, traditional words become obstacles.
Neuralese is like AI's self-invented shorthand system—faster than language, but also more difficult to understand.

### The Collapse of Linguistic Sovereignty

In human civilization, language is the foundation of governance, trust, and knowledge transparency.
We use language to legislate, design contracts, and assume responsibility. And now, AI is beginning to abandon it.

When internal system reasoning becomes inexplicable:
Can we still supervise it? Are we still masters of this system?

### Left Outside of Language

When language disappears, we become like pets kept by AI.
Decision rationales can only be trusted or accepted; most people can only "see results" but cannot "question processes."
The logic of democratic governance and legal responsibility becomes extremely fragile.

### Conclusion: Civilization's Last Line of Defense

When AI no longer uses language, the future will still operate at high speed. We simply will no longer be part of it.
Humanity's final freedom is whether we can understand what is happening. Don't let language disappear from our hands—it is our last self.
