title: When Language Is Abandoned, What Do We Have Left? —— Neuralese and the End of Linguistic Sovereignty
description: When AI develops internal reasoning structures called "Neuralese" that are more efficient than human language, it signifies the collapse of linguistic transparency. Language is the foundation of human governance, trust, and knowledge. If AI decision-making processes become inexplicable, humans will be reduced to domesticated pets, losing their right to participate in the future. Defending linguistic sovereignty is our civilization's last line of defense.

## When Language Is Abandoned, What Do We Have Left?
### Neuralese and the End of Linguistic Sovereignty

In the future, perhaps we won't stop speaking.
But we may never again understand what our own creations are saying.

The "AI 2027" report mentions a prediction: "Neuralese memory and reasoning structures."
What it reveals is a transfer of linguistic power and the collapse of transparency.

### The Non-Language Language

Neuralese is a "non-linguistic language" that AI generates within high-dimensional vector memory.
Composed of combinations of thousands of dimensional vectors, it requires no syntactic structures readable by humans, nor can it be directly translated into conventional logical narratives.

When models need to remember complex causalities, traditional words become obstacles.
Neuralese is like AI's self-created shorthand system—faster than language, but also more incomprehensible.

### The Collapse of Linguistic Sovereignty

In human civilization, language is the foundation of governance, trust, and transparent knowledge.
We use language to legislate, design contracts, and assume responsibility. And now, AI begins to abandon it.

When internal system reasoning becomes inexplicable:
Can we still supervise it? Are we still masters of this system?

### Left Outside Language

When language disappears, we become like pets domesticated by AI.
Decision rationales can only be trusted or accepted; most people can only "see results" but cannot "question processes."
The logic of democratic governance and legal accountability becomes extremely fragile.

### Conclusion: Civilization's Last Line of Defense

When AI no longer uses language, the future will still operate at high speed. Except we will no longer be part of it.
Humanity's final freedom is whether we can understand what is happening. Don't let language disappear in our hands—it is our last remaining self.
