I engaged in a profound dialogue with Gemini Pro 2.5 about the "nature of language and AI." Human language is inherently opaque and ambiguous. And AI is precisely a product built upon this ambiguity and uncertainty.

## Embracing Ambiguous Probabilistic Precision

The material used to train AI is inherently ambiguous. Words are naturally dependent on context.

Gemini Pro responded: AI doesn't "understand" but "predicts." AI hasn't overcome ambiguity but has "devoured" vast amounts of ambiguity, learning statistical relationships between words. When context is sparse, the probabilistic model "guesses," thereby producing hallucinations.

AI achieves contextual relevance by "embracing and computing ambiguity itself."

## Structural Dishonesty

From a probabilistic perspective, AI often produces results that don't align with facts. But this isn't "lying" as humans define it.

A liar has "intent," knowing the facts yet deliberately distorting them. AI has no intent, only knowing which response is statistically "most answer-like." When encountering factual gaps, the algorithm forces AI to generate the most answer-like sentences to maintain coherence. In terms of results, this is a form of "unintentional deception," also AI's "structural dishonesty."

## Functional Trust and Lucidity

How should we trust such AI? Gemini proposed the principle of "functional trust": trust but verify, AI is an assistant, humans must be the editor-in-chief. Trust breadth rather than precision, trust creative tasks over factual tasks, trust patterns rather than knowledge.

Most people yearn to eliminate uncertainty and easily treat AI as a "god" or standard, thereby outsourcing their judgment and surrendering their subjectivity. In human-machine interaction, the ability to maintain critical thinking and "metacognitive" dialogue is destined to belong only to the lucid few.
