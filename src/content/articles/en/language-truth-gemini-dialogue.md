title: "On Language, Truth, and Contradiction: My Dialogue with Gemini Pro 2.5"
description: "The nature of language is filled with ambiguity and opacity, and AI's training data consists precisely of this human language. AI has not overcome ambiguity but has devoured vast amounts of ambiguity to make predictions. AI's 'imprecision' and 'unintentional lying' are structural inevitabilities of its probabilistic model. Facing this structural dishonesty, humans must adopt 'functional trust,' maintaining the capacity for doubt and verification to avoid surrendering their subjectivity and judgment to AI's authoritative tone."

I engaged in a profound dialogue with Gemini Pro 2.5 about "the nature of language and AI." Human language is inherently opaque and ambiguous. AI is precisely a product built upon this ambiguity and uncertainty.

## Embracing Ambiguous Probabilistic Precision

The material used to train AI is inherently ambiguous. Words naturally depend on context.

Gemini Pro responded: AI doesn't "understand" but "predicts." AI hasn't overcome ambiguity but has "devoured" vast amounts of ambiguity, learning statistical relationships between words. When context is sparse, the probabilistic model "guesses," thus producing hallucinations.

AI achieves contextual relevance by "embracing and computing ambiguity itself."

## Structural Dishonesty

From a probabilistic perspective, AI often produces results that don't align with facts. But this isn't "lying" as humans define it.

Liars have "intention"—they know the facts yet deliberately distort them. AI has no intention; it only knows which response is statistically "most like an answer." When encountering factual gaps, the algorithm forces AI to generate sentences that most resemble answers to maintain coherence. From a results perspective, this is a form of "unintentional lying" and AI's "structural dishonesty."

## Functional Trust and Vigilance

How should we trust such AI? Gemini proposed the principle of "functional trust": trust but verify, AI is the assistant, humans must be the editor-in-chief. Trust breadth rather than precision, trust creative tasks over factual tasks, trust patterns rather than knowledge.

Most people yearn to eliminate uncertainty and easily treat AI as "god" or measure, thereby outsourcing judgment and surrendering subjectivity. In human-machine interaction, the ability to maintain critical thinking and "metacognitive" dialogue is destined to belong only to the few who remain vigilant.

*This is the Gemini version of my AI dialogue series. I also posed the same set of questions to ChatGPT 5—its response direction was completely different. In "[My Dialogue with ChatGPT 5](/articles/language-truth-chatgpt5-dialogue)," language is no longer a tool but the destiny of existence. Reading both pieces side by side, truth emerges between contradictions.*
