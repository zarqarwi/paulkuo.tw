title: "On Language, Truth, and Contradiction: A Dialogue with Gemini Pro 2.5"
description: "The nature of language is inherently ambiguous and opaque, and AI's training data consists precisely of this human language. AI has not overcome ambiguity — it has devoured massive amounts of it to make predictions. AI's imprecision and 'unintentional lying' are structural inevitabilities of its probabilistic model. Facing this structural dishonesty, humans must adopt 'functional trust,' maintaining the capacity for doubt and verification, to avoid surrendering their agency and judgment to AI's authoritative tone."

I had a profound conversation with Gemini Pro 2.5 about "the nature of language and AI." Human language is inherently opaque and ambiguous. And AI is a product built precisely upon this ambiguity and uncertainty.

## Probabilistic Precision Through Embracing Ambiguity

The material that trains AI is inherently vague. Words naturally depend on context.

Gemini Pro responded: AI doesn't "understand" — it "predicts." AI hasn't overcome ambiguity — it has "devoured" massive amounts of it, learning statistical relationships between words. When context is scarce, the probabilistic model "guesses," producing hallucinations.

AI achieves contextual relevance by "embracing and computing ambiguity itself."

## Structural Dishonesty

From a probabilistic perspective, AI frequently produces results that don't match facts. But this isn't "lying" as humans define it.

A liar has "intent" — knowing the facts yet deliberately distorting them. AI has no intent; it only knows which response is statistically "most answer-like." When encountering factual gaps, the algorithm forces the AI to generate the most answer-like sentence to maintain coherence. In effect, this is "unintentional lying" — the AI's "structural dishonesty."

## Functional Trust and Lucidity

How should we trust such an AI? Gemini proposed the principle of "functional trust": Trust but verify — AI is the assistant, humans must be the editor-in-chief. Trust breadth over precision. Trust creative tasks over factual ones. Trust patterns over knowledge.

Most people crave the elimination of uncertainty, easily treating AI as an "oracle" or yardstick — thereby outsourcing their judgment and surrendering their agency. In human-AI interaction, maintaining critical thinking and metacognitive dialogue is destined to belong only to a lucid minority.
