          <h1>Paul Kuo 郭曜郎</h1>
          <p>My starting point is not technology — it is order.</p>
          <p>Fifteen years of theological training taught me to ask one question: amid chaos and acceleration, what kind of structure can truly bear meaning? That question led me out of seminary and into entrepreneurship — not because I abandoned faith, but because I wanted to test in the real world whether order and ethics can be rebuilt.</p>
          <p>From the formation of startup ecosystems, to the restructuring of food-agriculture supply chains, to sustainable architecture and spatial practice — I spent over a decade understanding that systemic regeneration is never merely a technical problem. It is the building of trust and responsibility. To bear the risk of transformation is to participate in the shaping of a new order.</p>
          <p>My current work spans cross-border industry collaboration between Taiwan and Japan, and building CircleFlow as a data infrastructure for the circular economy. As AI rapidly becomes part of our foundational infrastructure, technology is redefining the scale of capability and decision-making.</p>
          <p>Technology itself has no intent, but the logic of efficiency, left unchecked, tends to compress the space for human judgment and responsibility. What I care about is not how fast technology can move, but whether people can still retain dignity and agency amid the acceleration.</p>
